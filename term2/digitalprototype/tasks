[How Arduino is open-sourcing imagination | Massimo Banzi - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoBUXOOdLXY)

In the past, with the pre-course, the week of Tech Beyond the Myth and now the Prototyping for Design, I am getting closer to acquiring the set of skills that can serve as a base to anything I would like to make. These things do not seem as foreign to me and I am befriending electronics, getting excited about prototyping and viewing software as micro-challenges instead of focusing on expertise. I am happy that we are getting more time to explore the maker's world and find ways to incorporate some of that knowledge and instruments into our projects. My interests rely on non-western-centric world views and interspecies collaboration, but when it comes to making I am deeply interested in making science more accessible and hacking Biology, not only in access to knowledge sources but also facilities/infrastructures/instruments and the tools used to bring Biology into different spaces. Science is a societal construct that can be proven by mathematical arguments and reproduced through sets of experiments, consequently, its reliability and significance have been settled as our default way of getting to know the unknown, so in the following weeks I hope I can put myself in the shoes of a “maker” and DIY my way into things that enable other ways of getting to know the world that surrounds us be it trough scientific ways or not. We will see only time can tell what I will come up with.

## Task 1.0

Until now we have had classes with Victor and Eduardo. And with those knowledge inputs, there were tasks as outputs. As Victor guides us through the basics of Arduino, the selection of boards, the maker community, resources for further explorations, and anything electronics, Task 1.0 is to make our Arduino music with an Arduino board. I was convinced I had forgotten what I learned in previous weeks but not really, I did all the basics without struggling too much: a closed circuit, indicated the right pins in the code, played around with the timing of the music, experimented with different songs and tried to understand the new parts, for example, the piezzo buzzer. This was fun, it seems like I am slowly getting into the right mindset for the Microchallenge week.

***How piezo buzzer works:** One could say that piezo buzzers are made of smart materials that change when voltage is applied, creating sound through the piezzo disk similar to what happens to a speaker’s cone. A source that helped me better understand what this buzzer was:* [https://www.cuidevices.com/blog/buzzer-basics-technologies-tones-and-driving-circuits](https://www.cuidevices.com/blog/buzzer-basics-technologies-tones-and-driving-circuits)

## Task 2.0

Task 2.0 relates to Eduardo’s class on 3D software and modeling. We started small by figuring out what came to mind when the word parametric was in the equation. Does this help us to get to know a three dimension object better? For me, it enabled a more structured and clear view of what lied in front of me or what I wished to build, by caring for its shapes/forms under metric systems.

## Task 2.1

As Eduardo gave us this next Task simultaneously I opened Rhino as it is widely used software in the Design world and more importantly, the machines in FabLab are compatible with this software. I came to know of its existence only during the pre-course. Needless to say that I no longer remembered 90% of what I’d learned. So, it was a nice surprise to open Rhino for the first time in the last 4 months and not be completely oblivious to some simple functions and tools. Still, I have a long way to go and figure out how to do this particular object I had in my mind - a paper mâché nest for transplanting plants into terrains that are stripped from life (it looks like a baking form for flan puddings). - I did not finish this task as I intended (having the object fully 3D modeled) but I wish to follow up and I will update this page.

## Task 3.0

MDEF is good at breaking complex subjects into pieces and making them more approachable. So once the task was set > Sami, Josephine, Jimena and I decided to sit down and figure it out together where half of us would be responsible for the LED setup and the other two for the light sensor setup. Constantly, coming together to situate ourselves in the process and find ways to surpass the obstacles. We had some troubles with it… but this is how far we got:

## Task 3.1

I was excited about the laser cutting! I did use the small laser cut last week during remixing materials, as Amanda already had used similar machines and so we decided to cut our bioplastic into butterfly shapes using the laser cut machine. This time around I used the medium laser cut machine and got to experiment a bit more with the preparation of the file.

1. Selected some fabric pictures > kapulana (Angola), pano di terra (Cabo Verde), Bogolan mudcloth (Mali)
2. narrowed it down to specific shapes and simplified forms
3. used Inkscape to translate images into vectors
4. passed it to Rhino

Once I passed the file to Rhino, the lines were duplicated and “crooked”. With the help of Ahmed, I then traced the patterns and transformed them into 2D drawings and joined polylines. These were the results:
