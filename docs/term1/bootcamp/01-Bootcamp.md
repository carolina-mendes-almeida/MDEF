“What is your fight?”

My fight is collaboration.


The word fight has many meanings depending on the context, but for me, the fittest
to this first assignment was: “to work hard to defeat, end, or prevent something”. I
started as being very analytical and rigid. A storm of questions and overall confusion
instantly invaded my mind. With such a narrow vision, I detached myself from the
initial question (lost track of it) and I almost presented a very predictable and
outdated version of myself in a scientific poster. Zooming out and seeing the full
narrative was essential. I realized this was the first step of an intertwined design of my
personal and professional life. I proceeded to center myself and anchored my
thoughts. Ultimately my values, principles, hopes, dreams and frustrations are the fuel
of my fight.

I believe in small acts of kindness, in the intrinsic value of the natural world, in the
strength of a community, in reason, and in knowledge-sharing. I thrive in the constant
cross-over and recombination of knowledge. I believe in the power of collaboration
be it between people or disciplines. My fight keeps my world in constant
homeostasis, by balancing movements, interactions and exchanges with the
surrounding environment.

To admire Nature is to celebrate diversity. I hope to bring harmony and increase
symbiotic relations between humans and non-humans, distancing ourselves from the
monoculture of the mind, spaces and nature. Through this program, I want to design
interventions that challenge the eco-apartheid we’ve been living in.

Visual notes and significance:

Statuette (past) - It is a symbol of Angolan culture. “The thinker” is of Chokwe origin
(Angolan ethnic group) and it represents the elders and wise ones of a community.
These leaders have the costume of listening to the rest of the village before
presenting their arguments or points of view, a diplomatic approach I admire and try
to apply whenever necessary.

Keywords (present) - the words surrounding the statuette show my (intellect)state
and positioning when starting a new project. These keywords are representative of
me at this point in time (October 2022).

Marine life (future) - Represents an ecological succession. In this collage, an
“ecosystem” is in development. With the passage of time, more life will bloom around
the statuette. At the end of the program a full ecosystem is grown, parallel to my own
path, more skills and interests will enrich the space around it.
