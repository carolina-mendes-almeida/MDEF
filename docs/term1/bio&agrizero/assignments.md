# Bio & Agri Zero

![fav photo](../../images/bioagri/favphoto.mp4)

After designing the perfect medium for different types of microorganisms we had to “hunt” them around IAAC (1). I was thinking of how I could get the most out of my medium when I found abandoned basil plants (2) casually hanging out just beside some bikes at Fablab. Sitting on top of the plant cuticle there were black dots. These are probably bug feces, and if so, they are thriving with life. I wonder what 24h in an incubator can reveal (3)…

My favorite photo of the week is an open petri dish with the sample I took (that I did not know what it was), under the cold incandescent light of a sterilized atmosphere. It’s my favorite because it was the first practical activity in the Bio Lab and it reminded me of how simple tools and protocols aligned with curiosity can take you into a different world within your own. It was experiences like this, that led me to science: the unknown (1) and the process of getting comfortable with it (2), yet curious enough to keep looking further (3). The chase of the unknown and the challenge keeps you in movement. Restless curiosity keeps the apathy of the world far away from you. And, once we saw the Petri boxes full of textures, reflections, colors and life, more questions popped up: How many types of organisms are on the Petri box? Were they all part of the microbiome of the bug or the basil leaf? Should I make more mediums to isolate each colony of bacteria? Do I have any of these microorganisms within me? How different am I from them? If they are the least complex out of the 3 biological domains, why do they seem so well organized? How can I contribute to their well-being? Can I ally with these beings?
