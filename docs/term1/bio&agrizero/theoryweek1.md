# Bio & Agri Zero

This week was filled with information (heavy) but it leveled the plane when it comes to the biological knowledge of the group. Because Nuria’s interventions were information dense I will highlight those that triggered other interesting research topics.

**First things first: Big Bang.**

Every element in the universe originated at this point in time and space: Big Bang. The beginning of this class was a journey through a cosmic calendar.

Reminded me of a very interesting way of addressing geological time by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-s4tqR8Bc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl-s4tqR8Bc)

**1 - Life on Earth**

Life is carbon-based. The first major transition was the leap from the molecular scale to the microbiology scale, this scaling up continues to form complex systems and communication networks until it took us into the realm of cultural evolution (designers normally operate here). At this point, *Homo sapiens* have been the most prominent agents of change on the Earth’s surface, making our way into the name of the Epoch: Anthropocene.

**1.1 - After the trigger of “Life on Earth”**

Complex systems were introduced by Nuria through Aristotle's quote: "The whole is more than the sum of its parts”. A few days before this class, Paige (one of our colleagues) recommended me an Invisibilia podcast episode about biological scale and it adds a new branch to this idea of complex systems that as a self-proclaimed cross-pollinator can be very helpful in developing new approaches to design.

The image represents side by side a scale in meters and the respective areas of knowledge. These worlds are all connected and full of opportunities they are just operating on different scales. (...)
