# Living With Your Ideas

These two weeks were dedicated to exploring FabLab tools and community, deconstructing pre-acquired knowledge or stigmas that kept knowledge h
idden, building fast prototyping skills, and understanding the politics of technology and inquiry about the tech industry.
It was empowering as I was oblivious to the reality of the tech industry, twirling inside these systems unaware of their existence and of my rights even when it came to objects I owned. I am glad I questioned, pushed myself and deep dived into what Victor, Guillem, Eduardo and Santi thought.

The ups and downs were constant and of great amplitude! It was a roller coaster and I wouldn't change anything. What follows this introduction is just a glimpse of what happened with some extra commentary at the end.
