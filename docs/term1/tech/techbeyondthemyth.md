# Tech Beyond the Myth
**Undoing Design's Black box**


These two weeks were dedicated to exploring FabLab tools and community, deconstructing pre-acquired knowledge or stigmas that kept knowledge h
idden, building fast prototyping skills, and understanding the politics of technology and inquiry about the tech industry.
It was empowering as I was oblivious to the reality of the tech industry, twirling inside these systems unaware of their existence and of my rights even when it came to objects I owned. I am glad I questioned, pushed myself and deep dived into what Victor, Guillem, Eduardo and Santi thought.

The ups and downs were constant and of great amplitude! It was a roller coaster and I wouldn't change anything. What follows this introduction is just a glimpse of what happened with some extra commentary at the end.

Sadly, there are systems of power with companies and the capitalist system as higher interests. However, there is power in knowing this. The system and the biased algorithms are games that can be played for the greater good. On the 9th of November, I visited CCCB for a screening of Ex-Machina by Alex Garland and a commentary by Ana Freire. Ex-Machina is a movie I cannot recommend enough, but the commentary by Ana Freire (PhD in Computer Engineering, lecturer and researcher at Pompeu Fabra University) opened my horizons. Ana is leading the STOP project (Suicide prevenTion in sOcial Platforms), "the objective of this project is to apply Artificial Intelligence to social media data to discover suicide-related patterns: suicide ideation, depression, and eating disorders. We explore behavioral, relational, and multimodal data extracted from social media and develop machine learning models to detect risk patterns. All our data is anonymized to protect the privacy of the users". It was a great event to attend during the first week of *Tech Beyond the Myth*.
