# Research through Design (RtD)
**Prototype Roles Reflections**

Even though I have never designed, some of the prototype roles sounded familiar. Bellow, I describe how I came in contact with them, even before I knew of their existence.

**Role 1:** This would have been a useful approach to a project in the third year of my Biology Bachelor's degree. For a class on population dynamics, I had the idea to test if the color preference of *Harmonia axyridis* is sex-dependent, meaning if males and females have the same color preference. In nature, that could translate into high probabilities of finding males and females in the same-colored flowers. It ended up being an inconclusive study, due to many factors, but now I see how I should've spent more time prototyping different experimental sets. The set for this experiment consisted of a 30x38cm transparent acrylic box and in each corner, there were different colored sticker paper (yellow, green, blue and red). Insects like *Harmonia axyridis* have apical tendencies (to visit the apex of branches/buds), even though it was not registered this could be a possible non-detected variable: the colors of the stickers on top of the box vs the colors placed at the basis of the acrylic box. Another example of a non-tested variable is the intensity of the colors. For instance, the chosen colors were very bright and rarely observed in a natural environment, so testing with colors in wavelengths closer to those we find in nature would very likely change the results.

**Role 4:** In scientific fields, ex. biology, to make new discoveries it is common that before particular research you have the creation of an instrument or technic that will lead or allows the analyses of the phenomena. During my time at a scientific institution, we would recall stories of times when research corroborating a biological hypothesis was highly celebrated vs the development of a new technic. The paradigm has definitely shifted as administration and scientists realized that without these new technics (ex. electric microscopy technics), they could make more meaningful and ground-breaking discoveries as it allowed them to see a phenomenon through new lenses.

This led me to research more about how science and design relate to each other. At the beginning of the class, when asked if we had ever used such roles, my immediate response was “Not really, but kind of…”. In science, the way we view something or relate to it is viewed negatively, even the way you write should never be in the first person. Yet, after writing about how I used the roles before, I see how they can be complementary and enrich each other's research.
