# Future Talks
Future Talks provide us with a glimpse of inspiring people, projects, and ideas, serving as a living archive of possibilities. Meeting Audrey Desjardines, Laura Forlano, Fred Van Amstel, Julia Ballesteros, and Milena Rosés has broadened my understanding of various topics and their interconnectedness.

The concept of autobiographic design, discussed in the first Future Talk, deeply resonated with me. It raised questions about how to work with local knowledge and resources without it becoming a mere reflection of oneself. It emphasized the importance of considering the landscape, physical world, documentation, and ecological reality of a specific location in the design process. Additionally, it prompted me to contemplate how one can embody their privileges, acknowledge systems of oppression, and actively work towards dismantling them, all while cultivating a deep understanding of oneself, surroundings, and history. These talks reminded me that personal growth and self-awareness are essential before attempting to shape the world.

Furthermore, Laura Forlano's discussion on augmenting our abilities, states of being, and biological performance intrigued me. It made me question the role of self-mapping in achieving body expansion and the potential for using this understanding in design.

These talks compelled me to reassess my own approach to documenting, sharing, and positioning myself in the world. I realized the significance of envisioning the bigger picture and curating my ideas and experiences based on the inputs from my local reality, which is globally connected. Shifting the engines of my process toward a more holistic and curated approach allows me to craft meaningful experiences for others while embracing the unpredictability and uncertainty of outcomes. This was one of the most important lessons I learned from this trimester, and it was present in each Future Talk. Additionally, I recognized the importance of active collaboration and co-design not only with humans but also with other living creatures and non-humans.

Through these talks, I observed that these individuals are deeply engaged with their inner worlds. Facilitating meaningful spaces hinges on knowing myself, engaging in healing, decolonization, and self-mapping. This self-awareness enables me to guide participants in exploring their inner and outer worlds with a sense of flow. My vision is ever-evolving and never stagnant.

The Alternative Presents serve as building blocks for my Poster Fight. As I construct an Alternative Present, I trace the steps toward reaching my Fight Poster. The representation of the Alternative Present, with intersecting circumferences and an open hand symbolizing giving and receiving, reflects my commitment to three main topics: empowering peaceful actions, reclaiming what has been lost, and engaging in participatory design and storytelling.

In summary, these Future Talks have not only expanded my perspectives but have also influenced my personal path. They have prompted me to reassess my approach, embrace self-awareness, and work towards creating alternative presents that align with my vision and values.
