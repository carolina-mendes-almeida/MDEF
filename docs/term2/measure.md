# Measuring the World

Not everything that is open is accessible. What is data? What is information? How much is it worth in today's world? Is there a value on data? How can data be collected? And is it important on its own, meaning is there an intrinsic value to data? These were all questions discussed during this class. Exactly what I was thinking... Hard concepts to grasp at first try! But when you learn together, you learn faster, as well as the intricacies of the bulky themes and concepts you come across during these seminars.

So, during the seminar, we explored data collection, its biases, and the impact on privacy (this last one was a HUGE theme in our group, as we made use of cameras in public spaces). We divided into groups to investigate curiosity triggers, using cameras and QR codes for data collection. It absolutely raised awareness about daily surveillance, the challenges of interpreting data, and how we blindly trust QR codes and the risks they entail. We also discussed digital slavery and the potential of data scraping. Overall, it sparked valuable discussions and highlighted the complexities of measuring curiosity, individual privacy, and the need to question things we've just accepted in our daily lives as normal, such as QR codes.
