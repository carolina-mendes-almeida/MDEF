After our first Future Talk on Autobiographic Design I can see how this approach is tied to everything else, and every Future Talk. How can one individual work with local knowledge and resources without it being an autobiography of themselves, the landscape, and the ecologic reality of that location? How can one embody, and acknowledge their privileges and work to dismantle systems of oppression without a deep sense of themselves, their surroundings and History? Can we augment our abilities, states of being, and biological performance without mapping ourselves? To do first-person design is to shape ourselves and our experiences first and foremost before shaping the world, and that is fair, that is right.

This particular chapter is about how I have updated my vision. I would say my envisioning of the bigger picture is in alignment with the topics of the Future Talks. This vision of mine is being taken care of, carefully curated, crafted, and growing with these different inputs. The engines are being shifted, what I mean is the process is becoming more wholesome and also more carefully curated. How I craft experiences for others and my awareness of the unpredictability and uncertainty of the outcomes of those particular interventions are more open to the active collaboration and co-design of the participants. Those participants might be humans but also other living creatures and non-humans. The most important thing I can bring to those spaces is knowing myself, healing, decolonizing, and mapping myself, so I can guide and facilitate activities bringing participants into their inner and outer worlds with the flow of life. The vision is ever-evolving never stagnant.

The Alternative Presents are the building blocks of my Poster Fight. By doing the Alternative Present Poster I am tracing the steps into the Poster Fight. One can say we started with the final and ultimate goal and now we are seeing how to get there. For the representation of the Alternative Present I had a very simple diagram of 3 intersected circumferences and an image of an open hand, a hand that is receiving and giving. My 3 main topics to sustain my fight and build alternative presents are:
- power to the peaceful
- retrieve what once was lost
- participatory design and storytelling
