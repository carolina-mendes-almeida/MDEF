# About me

Welcome to my digital research notebook. It will consist of a record of procedures, background research, exploratory research, thought process registration, materials and projects that made up my academic year at Elisava/IAAC/FabLab as a 22/23 MDEF student.

In one single word, I am a cross-pollinator, always establishing connections between different disciplines. With a background in biology, I hope to build connections with design, develop practices that challenge the social status quo, and mitigate the monoculture of Nature and the mind.
