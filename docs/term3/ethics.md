# Design Ethics
***Key-words: Technology, Design, Ethics, Social networks, Post-Natural, Professions***

The Master Program is full of intriguing classes, but Ariel's classes have definitely secured a spot in my top three favorites. The amount of references and organized chaos, along with the flow and communication of abstract concepts grounded in reality, and the ability to address real issues while still allowing for different perspectives without polarization - it was all simply amazing! The excitement was palpable in the room, but with so much information to take in, it was hard to know where to start.

Luckily, Ariel started us off with a fascinating topic - "our world." The discussion began by acknowledging the natural and artificial parts of our world, including humans and other living creatures. It's difficult to fully explain the depth of the conversation, but recently trough another program I am part of (Ruido Ê) I was introduced to a beautiful piece that perfectly summarized the first hours of the class:

Through this discussion, we explored the concept of what is truly natural, and how technology fits into this equation. And, question the root of the problem and if that is a relevant discussion at all because tech is everywhere! A heavy underlining conversation that goes beyond the traditional dichotomy of nature versus technology. We delved into the idea of socially acceptable technology and how it's involved in our social networks. We also examined the transformative power of technology and how it affects our capacity as human beings.

The discussions were incredibly thought-provoking and fruitful, with each class complementing the previous one and adding to our understanding of what it means to be a Designer - especially in a world that is constantly evolving with technology.

In the second class, we continued to be engaged and thirsty for more. We were introduced to Normative ethics and reflected on the role of Designers in society. We discussed different takes on theories of care and feminism and tried to define what design really means. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that professions are moral projects, and as Designers, we not only need to design for others but also for the type of Designer we ought to be.

Overall, Ariel's classes have been a true highlight of the Master Program. The discussions and explorations into these complex topics have been eye-opening and have broadened our understanding of what it means to be a Designer in today's ever-evolving world.
