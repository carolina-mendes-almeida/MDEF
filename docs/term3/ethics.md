# Design Ethics
***Key-words: Technology, Design, Ethics, Social networks, Post-Natural, Professions***

The Master Program is full of intriguing classes, but Ariel's classes have definitely secured a spot in my top three favorites. The amount of references and organized chaos, along with the flow and communication of abstract concepts grounded in reality, and the ability to address real issues while still allowing for different perspectives without the risk of polarization - it was all simply amazing! The excitement was palpable in the room, but with so much information to take in, it is hard to know where to start this reflection…

So I decided to carry you trough: Ariel started us off with a fascinating topic - "our world." The discussion began by acknowledging the natural and artificial parts of our world, including humans and other living creatures. It's difficult to fully explain the depth of the conversation, but recently trough another program I am part of (Ruido Ê) I was introduced to a beautiful piece that perfectly summarized the first hours of the class:

Through this discussion, we explored the concept of what is truly natural, and how technology fits into this equation. Even questioning the root of the problem and reflect - is it a relevant discussion at all? Tech is everywhere! A heavy underlining conversation that goes beyond the traditional dichotomy of nature versus technology. We delved into the idea of socially acceptable technology and how it's involved in our social networks, from golf cars to manipulating genes to make the perfect babies (whatever that is the current times). We also examined the transformative power of technology and how it affects our capacities and capabilities as human beings.

The discussions were incredibly thought-provoking and fruitful, the class kept returning to what it means to be a Designer (a reminder of why we were sharing that space with Ariel) - especially in a world that is constantly evolving with technology.

In the second class, we continued to be super engaged and thirsty for more. We were introduced to Normative ethics and reflected on the role of Designers in society. We discussed different takes on theories of care and feminism and tried to define what design really means. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that professions are moral projects, and as Designers, we not only need to design for others but also for the type of Designer we ought to be.

When Ariel asked us: “What is Design?”, I was so deeply overwhelmed and caught up in the paradox of everything/nothing. I was trying to come with terms with my beliefs of what Design truly is (if such understanding is even possible), when I started to imagine the removal of design altogether. Through this thought experiment, I realized that Design is like a missing piece, that is deeply missed when it's no longer in the equation of our reality. Although I am still unsure of how to define it, this perspective has helped me grasp the significance and impact that Design has on the planet.

The discussions and explorations into these complex topics have been eye-opening and have broadened my understanding of what it means to be a Designer today.
