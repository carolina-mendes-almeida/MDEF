# **Scalability - Designing Yourself Out - Decentralized Strategies for Sustaining Continuity and Scalability.**

## **Activity 1.0 - The 5 Ws of Scaling | MOC**

## **MUSEUM OF COLONIZATION**

**Why?**

- The world is a museum of colonization. It would only make sense to build local communities globally connected.

**What?**

- Co-designing and unleashing creativity among the BIPOC community through interactive maps, open calls for designing VR experiences for the tour, sharing knowledge and skills on decolonization. Create joy.

**Who?**

- Anyone interested in or developing decolonization work.

**Where?**

- Barcelona and Lisbon, at the moment. But as we grow our community, the MOC will be where those people are.

**When?**

- Not applicable. We will respect the team's availability and the interest of the community. We are not following rules; we are following and creating joy. But we expect to develop an online tour map by the end of summer.

## **Activity 1.1 - The 5 Ws of Scaling | Tarot**

## **INTERSPECIES TAROT**

**Why?**

- The world is occupied by nature, a multispecies universe that reacts and evolves with its biotic and abiotic environment. With the democratization of technology and biology, scientific advancements, Biohackers, BioDIY, Biodesigners, everyone will soon be working with life. In the meantime, it is obvious that even if we were not working with life directly, we indirectly affected it because we did not know, did not care, or were oblivious to others. Even though we can never know what it is like to be others, we can try to support others through our world design, to better accommodate the reality that we live in a multispecies world.

**What?**

- A deck of cards, in a tarot format, that awakens the inquisitive side of people working with other species, so their practices can better support their chosen non-human collaborators.

**Who?**

- Anyone interested in other species or establishing interspecies collaboration.

**Where?**

- Digital

**When?**

- We set a goal to have a full deck of cards by the end of the year. The ultimate goal is to publish the tarot deck online (open-source), enabling people to create their own cards and have a version that can be purchased.

## **Activity 2.2 - How? | MOC**

We will adopt a **collective/network model** as a short-term and feasible approach to work with our current energy. However, our long-term goal is to establish ourselves as a non-profit organization. The MOC serves as a space for envisioning alternative futures, reflecting on the past, fostering joy and connections. It caters to those experiencing a sense of diasporic longing and operates as a non-capitalistic group dedicated to promoting the work of BIPOC individuals in various creative areas around culture. Our objective is to transform the discourse around diversity into a supportive platform for BIPOC individuals, prioritizing their needs over mere panels and discussions, and creating inclusive spaces that celebrate joy and welcome the manifold.

## **Activity 2.1 - How? | INTERSPECIES TAROT**

The Interspecies Tarot aligns more closely with a **documentation/guide model**. It serves as a curated knowledge archive, drawing from the realms of sciences, humanities, arts, and indigenous wisdom. It is thoughtfully compiled with references and bibliographic sources for further consultation. This resource is designed to assist anyone working with other species, enabling them to navigate and better understand their chosen non-human collaborators. As we strive to gather this knowledge through open-source documents and research, it is obvious that our Tarot deck should also be made available as an open-source document, promoting accessibility and encouraging contributions from the community.
