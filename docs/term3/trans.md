# Critical Transfeminism Design

Again... This might be my favorite class (this it may be hard to believe, considering I've said that about so many classes before).

Laura introduced us to the intersections of transfeminism, transhumanism, and the debate on the human condition in relation to advanced technologies. These discussions sparked the most interesting conversations and moments of deep introspective silence, leaving everyone in awe! I feel like I could spend 200 hours in this class, and I'm determined to continue researching these topics on my own. They are incredibly fascinating, and their utilitarian and cultural value feels unparalleled. If we are building Futures, this is essential to the conversation. This class provokes complex and thought-provoking questions. So, let's reflect on the enhancement of human capabilities through technology (although I'm not sure if I can make significant contributions just yet, I'll give it a try).

Drums, please! This is what my Biology course never touched upon... The lack of diversity in science has significant consequences for the scientific output of these institutions. I do believe that transfeminism perspectives are needed not only in design but also in Biology (desperately, I might add).

And there will always be the crucial question of who has access to this biological knowledge and who gets to shape technology. What are the implications? Engaging in this debate sheds light on the profound ethical considerations that arise when grappling with the potential consequences of hyper-sophisticated technologies like CRISPR and exploring hormones and Biohacking.

It is important to recognize that people like Thomas Huxley played a pivotal role in shaping the discourse surrounding human nature. Huxley's emphasis on struggle within Darwin's theory aimed to justify a perceived natural order and legitimize capitalist and exploitative processes. His grandson, Julian Huxley, further promoted the idea of perfecting the human race through genetics, aligning with the principles of eugenics! It is essential to acknowledge that some perspectives view transhumanism as dangerously close to eugenics—an ideology associated with controlling or manipulating human genetics. This view is both gaslighting and ignorant! (These things leave me feeling really mad).

However, amidst these complex discussions, there is an opportunity to approach critique as a form of creativity. Examining power relations within this context reveals the different layers and dimensions of power, emphasizing the need for critical sense on the impact of technological advancements on marginalized groups.

Laura introduced us to the work of Demian DinêYazhi, which addresses indigenous experiences and perspectives. This greatly broadens the discourse, incorporating multiple voices and perspectives to enrich our understanding of the ethical, social, and cultural dimensions of these highly sophisticated technologies and their potential effects on the human condition.

Laura presented us with an infinite source of knowledge that made me want to immerse myself in a cave filled with books, just absorbing information. The references were stunning, and every classmate contributed to making them even more diverse.
