# Prototype for Design II

***First task: Simulate robot movement on Rhino***

Today was Robot day! Josep guided us trough the basics of using robotic arms. It was a lot of new information. At FabLab/IAAC we are working with robots with 6 axis, something you can normally tell by just looking at the number of joints. These robots can do almost anything, a particular advantage of using them as CNCs is the fact that they can mill with an angle, contrary to the CNC machines. After we got some basics down we moved on to the practical exercise. The class got to use the arm manually, using a controller, to fulfill a small task: lift the roll of tape on top of a cardboard box and put it back down :D

To automate a process using a robot like ABB 140, the user must do it with the Rhino and Grasshopper software. I had never used Grasshopper before. Sami, Josephine, Wen, and I set aside some time to tackle this task. By following the steps on the MDEF - FabLab website, we were able to complete the task and simulate a movement with the robotic arm at IAAC.
