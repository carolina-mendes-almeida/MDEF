# Prototype for Design II

***First task: Simulate robot movement on Rhino***

Today was Robot day! Josep guided us trough the basics of using robotic arms. It was a lot of new information. At FabLab/IAAC we are working with robots with 6 axis, something you can normally tell by just looking at the number of joints. These robots can do almost anything, a particular advantage of using them as CNCs is the fact that they can mill with an angle, contrary to the CNC machines. After we got some basics down we moved on to the practical exercise. The class got to use the arm manually, using a controller, to fulfill a small task: lift the roll of tape on top of a cardboard box and put it back down :D

To automate a process using a robot like ABB 140, the user must do it with the Rhino and Grasshopper software. I had never used Grasshopper before. Sami, Josephine, Wen, and I set aside some time to tackle this task. By following the steps on the MDEF - FabLab website, we were able to complete the task and simulate a movement with the robotic arm at IAAC.

***Second task: Get to know Blender***

During Victor's first class, we were introduced to an exciting new world: Blender as an interface. Blender is a powerful, open-source software that allows creative people to create amazing 3D animations without the constraints of shareholders, ownership, or a capitalistic focus on growth and profit.

The discussion on the best 3D modeling tool often turns into a personal preference battle, but it's important to consider other factors when choosing a tool. Tools are a medium to get to a goal, but in today’s world they show so much, and reflect so much of the world we live in. Payed softwares and subscriptions can be a obstacle for so many to learn and be proeficient in creating digital things. The tools we use shape our work and creative process, and the design of a tool deeply influences how we approach our ideas. Commercial tools prioritize profit in their design decisions, while community-driven open-source tools like Blender offer more potential for diverse paradigms and allow us to modify the tool to better suit our needs. As Victor says, we get to know the tool, to understand it and truly become proeficient in using it, as we understand its logic, principles, history and we become part of a community that helps each other.

A small note: Ton Roosendaal, the founder of Blender, is a fascinating and funny individual. In his 2022 Blender Conference introduction, he discussed the crises facing humanity in the coming years, and how that involves for example, human interfaces, especially 3D softwares as the building blocks of those alternative worlds (ex. meta verse and AI 🥲)

***Third task: Blender as Interface***

In order to use blender you have to be quite patient as it is not as intuitive as other softwares, at least those i am more used to. Victor gave us some helpful tips on how to use phyton to better manipulate Blender and master this software. This was quite an intense class, hard to grasp, despite the challenges of using Blender, I would like to become proficient enough to create small animations, but first I have to prioritize other projects that are at the moment more aligned with want I would like to develop 🥰

***Fourth task: Get to know Live coding as a human interface***

I found the examples shared by Citlali and Xavi in class to be incredibly interesting and strange. Xavi provided a general introduction to the best tools and frameworks used in human interfaces, while Citlali demonstrated how our bodies can serve as enriching tools for exploring technology through artistic experimentation.

One particularly practical exercise we engaged in was live coding with Citlali. This was an entirely new experience for me, and it was clear to me that there are entire universes of possibilities within the realm of technology. Anything is possible starts to seem like an understatement, we are only bounded by our imagination.

For the live coding exercise, we utilized Hydra, which is a visually oriented programming language that allows for real-time collaboration and experimentation. It was thrilling to see the results of our coding efforts manifesting in real-time on the screen! The colors and shapes were enticing and augmented the experience of coding and listening to music.

Citlali and Xavi's expertise and enthusiasm were infectious, and I feel inspired to continue exploring and learning more about the possibilities that these tools and frameworks have to offer.
