# Distributed Design

**Reflections on the exercises of this week**

***Reflection on the 12/04 - Mushroom Model***

**Learning Skills**
*Skills that can be translated into something useful.*

The mushroom design was something that I did know it even know it existed and I see now how it can be helpful way to map “something” with a supply chain. I also learned that simple objects that we take for granted can have a deep cultural history and their existence comes down to the ability to stay useful or relevant through out the years and the stories built around the object (emotional attachment).

**Dynamics**
*How was the dynamic inside the group?*

We randomly picked the hair clip (object to track), and the group was not the most excited about this task but we can see value in it - a way of brain storming the impacts of a “thing” in a more organized way. We also learned quite a lot about this daily object and their impact according to climate, social status, professional occupation, hair length and hair cultural value.

**Interactions**
*Did the role I played influenced my opinion, in other words, how my bias influenced my positioning*

I do think my role played an influence during the exercise. Firstly, I am human and highly biased by all my experiences. I was reluctant to start thinking about a hair clip and how that could help in any way my projects and interventions, but as I mentioned before there is something valuable in learning how to structure your brainstorms specially when you have to map so much it helps you start to think and act upon the subject at hands without getting too overwhelmed. I also found it helpful to move from overthinking into knowing, from data online and information into actionable and utilitarian knowledge.


***Reflection on the 13/04 - Reflection Tree***

**Learning Skills**
*Skills that can be translated into something useful?*

Yes, I did find the Refection Tree useful and more interesting than the Mushroom Model. I like to take my time and go deep into things which does not match some of my group colleagues paces, so its was this exercise gave me the opportunity to work at my own pace and on a project that I am passionate about: Interspecies Tarot. The structure of the activity was also a great idea! 1. work on your stuff, 2. discuss and share with the rest of the group, 3. share your findings with other groups and 4. embody your ideas. The last one is always a nice addition making you move, getting loose. For people, like myself, that do come from outside the design world it was a great thing to add to my personal toolkit.

**Dynamics**
*How was the dynamic inside the group?*

Like I briefly mentioned on the previous column I believe this was a more successful model than the mushroom, at least when it comes to our group, it had more opportunities to get inspired and it diversified the exercises within this activity. It was also a wonderful idea to take this exercise to the terrace. The group was more engaged.

**Interactions**
*Did the role I played influenced my opinion, in other words, how my bias influenced my positioning*

Because half of the activity was centered in our own personal projects when the group came together to discuss our takes on the exercise, we guided each other trough the values of Distributed Design, and would opnely share our takes on it and its applications to our individual projects. This time, even though I am sure I influenced my group, everyone had wonderful inputs that made our biases more balanced, besides we had very similar ideas and desires for how we what impact we want our projects to have.
