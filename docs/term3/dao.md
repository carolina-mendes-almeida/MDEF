# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
***Keywords: Digital formats and protocols; Bitcoin, NFTs, blockchain; Crypto Trends; Emerging technologies; Decentralized systems***

First class was with Guillem, and we disrupted what our view on digital formats and protocols. Guillem said: “*List at first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word bitcoin, nfts, blockchain”.*  They seemed disconnected from my personal interests. I couldn't help but think, "Aren't these just trends created by a specific group, primarily affluent white cisgender men, aiming to channel investment money into their own pockets?" However, as the classes progressed, my perspective on these emerging technologies began to shift.

If I were to answer Guillem's question now, I would say that these innovations represent an alternative means of exchanging goods. They are the product of collective efforts to reshape the narrative and establish more suitable protocols and stories that align with an increasingly digital world.

I confess I was perhaps a bit condescending and hasty in my initial impressions, but as I delved deeper into this subject, I realized that it was simply a matter of not dedicating enough time to these topics. Guillem's first class left a strong impression on me regarding the complexity of communication systems and the immense collective effort they require. The concept of decentralized systems and transparent transactions challenged my preconceived notions. Could these technologies potentially democratize access to financial services? Could they promote artistic expression? These so-called "trends" actually held immense possibilities.

Later, we had classes with Mar Canet, continuing where Guillem had left off. One of the first eye-opening slides presented the following:

10 industries that blockchain will disrupt in the future:

1. Banking
2. Cybersecurity
3. Supply chain management
4. Healthcare
5. Government
6. Insurance
7. Transportation
8. Cloud storage
9. Real estate
10. Art and design

By the end of this class, we had covered a vast amount of knowledge on NFTs, blockchain technology, the intersection of art and AI, the future of money and banks, cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, and more. However, I must admit that I struggled to keep up with the class, as I recognized a lack of basic financial knowledge within myself. It felt like I was skipping several steps on the ladder of understanding finances and emerging technologies.

The proposal for the class was to create a NFT that could leverage our current projects. I joined efforts with Paige and we created a NFT:

We created this NFT for 3 main reasons:

1. The NFT was created for the Interspecies Tarot project to provide funding and enable the realization and publication of the project. It serves as a unique digital asset with its own digital signature, holding value and contributing to the financial support of the project.
2. The NFT visually explores the diverse microcosms of the natural world and raises awareness about ecological issues and responsible design practices. It showcases the beauty and complexity of the natural world, encouraging a more empathetic and responsible approach to ecological design.
3. The use of NFTs in this project bridges the blockchain industry and the natural world. It allows the blockchain industry to invest in a project that promotes ecological awareness and demonstrates a commitment to sustainability. Additionally, the NFTs facilitate the exchange of ecological knowledge and resources, promoting collaboration and mutual aid among stakeholders interested in ecological issues.
