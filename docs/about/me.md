Welcome to my digital research notebook. It will consist of a record of procedures, background research, exploratory research, thought process registration, materials and projects that made up my academic year at Elisava/IAAC/FabLab as a MDEF student.

I am Carolina Almeida (she/her), a Portuguese-Angolan and a member of the MDEF class of 22/23. With a background in Environmental Biology and Science Democratization, I now work as a Designer dedicated to caring for our Interconnected World. I am drawn to topics such as Non-Western Centric Futures and Interspecies Collaboration. Throughout my time in MDEF, I have developed Ecofeminism workshops, artifacts for decolonization, tools for Interspecies Collaboration, and frameworks for creating transformative experiences that foster connections with non-human entities.

***Thank you for being here.***
