# About

![me at bar torres](../../images/bartorres1.jpg)

In one single word, I am a cross-pollinator, always establishing connections between different disciplines. With a background in biology, I hope to build connections with design, develop practices that challenge the social status quo, and mitigate the monoculture of Nature and the mind.
