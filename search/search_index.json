I was thinking of how I could get the most out of my medium when I found abandoned basil plants (2) casually hanging out just beside some bikes at Fablab.

The chase of the unknown and the challenge keeps you in movement. Restless curiosity keeps the apathy of the world far away from you. And, once we saw the Petri boxes full of textures, reflections, colors and life, more questions popped up: How many types of organisms are on the Petri box? Were they all part of the microbiome of the bug or the basil leaf? Should I make more mediums to isolate each colony of bacteria? Do I have any of these microorganisms within me? How different am I from them? If they are the least complex out of the 3 biological domains, why do they seem so well organized? How can I contribute to their well-being? Can I ally with these beings? Two months ago, in The New Yorker printed issue of 15 th of August, Jill Lepore\u2019s comment was published with the title: \u201cBringing Back the Woolly Mammoth: Americans have long understood the species\u2019 extinction as a warning. But is trying to \u201cde-extinct\u201d it really a good idea?\u201d. Mammoths ( Mammuthus sp. ) were part of the megafauna of the Pleistocene. They were herbivorous mammals that inhabited big areas from cold tundra steppe, arid grasslands, to temperate savanna-parklands, thanks to paleontological records scientists were able to identify different species and morphologies that enabled Mammuthus sp. to survive in these different environments (Enk J. et al., 2016). Now, with biotechnological advancements, companies like Colossal, work to bring back mammoths to recover lost ecological functions that could mitigate climate change. The plan, as Jill wrote, is for de-extinct mammoths to \u201cpopulate the permafrost and avert its melting by turning wet tundra into dry grasslands, which better sequester carbon and reflect sunlight, keeping the permafrost cooler and helping, thereby, to save the planet.\u201d It is important to keep the permafrost because these soil layers are often wet as well as cold, affecting oxidation/reduction, decomposition, and other biogeochemical processes. Storing organic matter underneath it since the Pleistocene (Ping C. et al., 2015). Zimov, N. S. et al. (2005) presented scenarios suggesting a rapid release of tens of kg C m2 when permafrost disappears. They also explored a solution: replacing the arid regions of Eastern Siberia (mossy forests and tundra dominated) with productive grasslands and abundant herbivorous animals. This transition could have effects on energy exchange strong enough, to reduce permafrost temperature and methane emission, allowing accumulation of tens of kg C m2. With the death of the mammoth came the extinction of a habitat: Mammoth Steppe a distinctive, now-vanished biome dominated by large mammal grazers (Wang, Y. et al., 2021) So, this is why this species is the Colossal\u2019s first choice of de-extinction as a climate change mitigation solution, the mammoth could enable the transition from tundra to the mammoth steppe. Creative and new solutions like this become more urgent with today\u2019s climate crisis. Governments are failing us and \u201ctrends in biodiversity have been declining and are projected to continue to do so\u201d (2020, Global Biodiversity Outlook 5). We need to keep looking for innovative ways of tackling this global issue, but is de-extinction the way to go? This last paragraph established a \u201cwhy\u201d, yet the questions keep coming. Jill, wrote that Colossal is planning on bringing the first mammoth calves by 2025. But where? We don\u2019t have the mammoth biome of 10.000 years ago and we will need it because once the technical hurdles of creating viable offspring of extinct animals are overcome, the species becomes a reintroduction candidate (J\u00f8rgensen D. et al.,2013). And we still do not agree on what the ultimate extinction cause of mammoths was (Lorenzen et al., 2011; Nikolskiy et al., 2011). It leaves us with more questions: Would it be a meaningful addiction to the local ecosystems? Could it regenerate the mammoth steppe or would it just worsen the condition of the current? What will the genetic pools of this mammoth population look like? Would they have evolutionary resistance? Before attempting de-extinction we should carefully access reintroduction parameters, as we cannot bring a living creature back to a non-existent habitat or one it cannot survive. But, let\u2019s say we do manage to have the habitat, then ultimately the success of the reintroduction would depend on their genetic arrangement and resilience to the current abiotic and biotic human-induced changes. Yet, even if Colossal manages to fill the genetic gaps in the mammoth genome it will be very difficult to secure the sustainability of a population with such little genetic material. The result would be low genetic variation within the population and increased inbreeding. There can also be undetected consequences beyond genetics for example epigenetics, behavior care or transmission of the microbiome, inputs very difficult to obtain if it was created in a biotechnological experiment or raised by other species (Robert a. et al, 2017). Unfortunately, I recognize these discontinuations as ingredients for an extinction vortex, putting the mammoth in line for its second-time extinction. I would also like to highlight that de-extinction is a great name for marketing and getting funds as it signifies undoing extinction when in reality Colossal is attempting to create a hybrid of an Asian Elephant that has cold resistance, smaller ears, fur and a thicker layer of fat, so it can withstand the cold of the tundra and fulfill its ecological role. This is not de-extinction, this is CRISPR-Cas9 enabling genetic improvements, because in the end once the extinction line is crossed you cannot undo it. And, this is the tip of the iceberg because I haven\u2019t even remotely touched the cultural or socioeconomic reality. One of the reasons conservation initiatives can fail is because of a lack of context, and species reintroduction is a conservation technic. The socioeconomic implications of the project have to be properly assessed as \u201chuman acceptance of reintroduction projects will be a crucial aspect to consider for de-extinction\u201d (J\u00f8rgensen, D. et al., 2013). And even if everything from the DNA editing to the populating of the permafrost works out, there are still bioethical questions needing answers: Does Colossal own these animals? What does this mean for the Nagoya Protocol? Are we going to have mammoth hamburgers and themed parks? As J\u00f8rgensen D. (2013) said de-extinction is not simply an intermediate between reintroduction and invasion, but much can be learned from case studies on these topics. There are issues of de-extinction that we are familiar with due to other conservation projects, but there is a dark side to the moon that we are not able to foresee. This is so innovative, some argue is parallel to the moon landing, but I agree with Jill\u2019s comment it makes almost no sense; it\u2019s too little, too late. It is great to entertain billionaires but as an innovative climate change solution\u2026 too late. My opinion changes when it comes to recently extinct species as, in the case of reintroductions, times between local extinction and the planned release range from a few years to a few 100 years, the levels of divergence between the environment and a de-extinct population would be less intense than the 4.000 year mammoth gap (Robert a. et al, 2017). How we answer these questions has the potential of shaping our biomes and the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere, but one thing about scientists, they don\u2019t stop in the face of adversity they thrive in these challenging environments. In the time spare, I can only hope the 75 million dollars invested in this company will help develop new scientific technics in genomics that could help us in different areas (from health to conservation). \u201cIt\u2019s a similar kind of ambitious, engineering-focused, team-based target that President Kennedy set when he declared we would put a person on the moon within a decade. The scientific challenges of this project are considerable but ultimately surmountable. The bioethical dimensions are paramount. The execution will no doubt be daunting.

The Creative Community Mapping is our main assignment for this week. We did this for a specific group/association as a case studio during class. I joined Wen and Cag\u00e7un as we were interested in an Association in the UK working with Earthships. This case study was retrieved from a document given during class. For the homework, I applied the same thought process for TopManta, one of the associations in Barcelona I would like to connect with. (Creative Communities examples used in class: Meroni, Anna. Creative communities. People inventing sustainable ways of living. Edizioni Polidesign, 2007.) Power Dynamics Power Dynamics When talking about community, as oneness and togetherness, it feels like we have set an intention of acting towards a greater good. Yes, you can recycle, compost, go vegan, or zero-waste but to do so embedded in a community is empowering and establishes stronger bonds - a blueprint for societal change. There is power in numbers. This takes us to what was tackled later in the week: power. I believe I have power but most of the time I am unaware of how much. After coming across the following papers: 1) \u201cThe P-Word: Power aversion and responsibility aversion as explanations for the avoidance of power\u201d; 2) \u201cWho Wants to Get to the Top? Class and Lay Theories About Power\u201d, my view on power changed as I realized that my background (mixed race woman and raised in a family of immigrants), values and principles constrained my views, search and the notion of power. In summary, these papers speak about how some communities, especially those on the margins of society, do not actively search for positions of power and even avoided it, by thinking it is inherently negative (something I related to). So why do individuals from lower classes don\u2019t seek power as avidly as higher-class individuals? Low-class individuals are less interested in seeking positions of power using political means, and as a result less interested in seeking positions of power more broadly; They perceive that for advancement you need to play politics, so they then fail to pursue advancement and further contribute to their low status; There is inner conflict, lower class individuals tend to focus on the community more than on themselves clashing with some concepts of pursuing positions of power in politics; But there are two particular situations where low-class individuals are as interested in acquiring positions of power as individuals from higher classes: \u201cwhen advancement comes explicitly from prosocial means rather than from political means and to some extent when they frame power as a superordinate other-focused goal\u201d. It highlights how difficult but how necessary it is to have class-based diversity within power positions. The community-driven professional goals of BIPOC folks are well represented in this example given by Neil deGrasse (Astrophysicist) when one of his (black) friends says: \u201cAstrophysics? The black community cannot afford the luxury of someone of your intellect to spend it on that subject.\u201d Making him feel guilty about not doing enough to help others. You can watch the full video here: A Story About Race Neil deGrasse Tyson - YouTube . Not to say that every BIPOC struggle is due to our conception of power, it is much more complex, but it is freeing to detach evilness from power and move forward without that guilt. Representation and Diversity Just like sustainability, these words are thrown around every day. But what does it mean to have representation and diversity within a group of people? It means to consciously open space to those who have been marginalized by society (at different levels), it\u2019s creating equal opportunities through equity,\u2026 And there is the need to actively do so! We have to be intentional in opening these spaces because historically, for centuries, there were intentional acts of discrimination that led to generational consequences, keeping these groups under the tight and inhumane grip of exploitation, translating into a societal system that has roots in colonization, capitalism, and ecological destruction. Also, it is a fact that diversity is a driver of innovation, creativity, and productivity. The \u201cwhy\u201d is settled, but \u201chow\u201d is the million-dollar question. I was the 1 black student in 300 students at my Bachelor\u2019s in Biology (Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon). If, any of the professors opened a job/intern opportunity no matter how inclusive they would like to be the chances of that person being BIPOC was 1/300. There is so much resistance in the current system to open space to unprivileged and marginalized groups in higher education. So, clearly, something happens before college because 1/300 is not representative of the BIPOC population interested in life sciences (Lisbon - Portugal), and I believe that institutions that produce new knowledge and are aiming to lead a new generation of free thinkers must have this subject as one of their higher priorities: the inclusion of BIPOC, Queer and LGBTQ+, People with disabilities, cognitive and background diversity. Design can be hopeful and open doors to new realities that are non-western centric: Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9: How to build with clay\u2026 and community - YouTube Futures Literacy What a privilege it is to have these Future perspectives, possibilities and realities colliding and even to develop foresight skills as the majority awakes to the threats of the socio-ecological crisis, a feeling of despair that is so familiar to Indigenous, Queer and many diaspora communities around the world. When researching about the community I was trying to search for resources that were non-western centered, when something came up called: Futures Literacy (FL) , something I have never heard of but has been around since the beginning of this century. FL is rooted in the notions of \u201cusing the future\u201d. \u201cThe future does not exist in the present but anticipation does. The form the future takes in the present is anticipation.\u201d Using the cross-over of theory and practice of Anticipation Systems (AS), the future is integrated into the present, and that happens constantly trough out our daily-life having the potential of helping us overturn into new frames of mind. For example: Efforts to recognise and preserve cultural heritage, in all its forms, are fundamentally linked to views of the past, present and future. As a result, the anticipatory assumptions that form the foundation for imagining the future play a determinant role in understanding what cultural heritage is, which aspects are deemed worth preserving and how to attempt to assure durability or continuity. I am interested in researching more on FL to redeem colonization and Bayo Akomolafe , the writer and founder of The Emergence Network in Nigeria, has some great thoughts on this topic \u201cColonisation was really about homogenization and mass production. It was also about the sterilization of hope, the failure of imagination, and the condensation of the manifold to a single story.\u201d There are more stories and futures beyond the capitalist, colonizer and industrial imposed ones under the (still) suffocating systems of oppression, there are futures that look like community, unity, abundance, and diversity, which are welcoming and freeing. Those emerging possibilities are the ones I am fighting for. Facilitating To be a facilitator is a role of great responsibility. It is the role of an active listener, mediator, curator, communicator, time manager, open-minded and at the center of everything a great facilitator is a channel of love and tolerance for that particular group. This word was introduced to the class and attached to another concept: Social Capital. As we are all part of a group in relation to something else. That lead us to the final exercise of the week where we embodied a system to better understand it. This is when M\u00e9rce introduced us to Embodied Theatre. With that exercise we explored with our bodies the role of students, politics, citizens, money, governments, research and funding I then explored another topic that I was constantly confroted with in the past related to excellence and expertise (meritocracy systems). No (self) judgment and meritocracy With the time I spent in Scientific institutions, there was an underlying discussion of what is excellence. Excellence has always been viewed as an ally to scientific innovation, but is it really? This is currently a hot topic in scientific institutions. I came across this AEON article that exposes the following thoughts: - rather than excellence a team of people should bring diverse knowledge bases, tools and analytic skills to the table - Optimal hiring depends on context - \u201cgiven a specific task and the composition of a particular team, one would be more likely to contribute than another\u201d \u2018Having people who have different mental perspectives is what\u2019s important. If you want to explore things you haven\u2019t explored, having people who look just like you and think just like you is not the best way.\u2019 - Astro Teller, CEO of X - \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d Mentioned article: Why hiring the best people produces the least creative results But what happens when you have the role of facilitator within an environment that places you in contact with something more-than-human? As we moved into the assignments related to Design Dialogues this particular theme shined the brighter and reminded me of what Ron Wakkary said during his lecture: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to be inclusionary but it is possible to be tentacular and collective in our design.\u201d Since then, together with the group Augmented Creativity - Myrto, Stella, Paige, Mariana and I - decided to join forces to bring in order to explore the following question: How to facilitate interactions with something that is more than human?

Also, it is a fact that diversity is a driver of innovation, creativity, and productivity. The \u201cwhy\u201d is settled, but \u201chow\u201d is the million-dollar question. I was the 1 black student in 300 students at my Bachelor\u2019s in Biology (Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon). If, any of the professors opened a job/intern opportunity no matter how inclusive they would like to be the chances of that person being BIPOC was 1/300. There is so much resistance in the current system to open space to unprivileged and marginalized groups in higher education. So, clearly, something happens before college because 1/300 is not representative of the BIPOC population interested in life sciences (Lisbon - Portugal), and I believe that institutions that produce new knowledge and are aiming to lead a new generation of free thinkers must have this subject as one of their higher priorities: the inclusion of BIPOC, Queer and LGBTQ+, People with disabilities, cognitive and background diversity. Design can be hopeful and open doors to new realities that are non-western centric: Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9: How to build with clay\u2026 and community - YouTube Futures Literacy What a privilege it is to have these Future perspectives, possibilities and realities colliding and even to develop foresight skills as the majority awakes to the threats of the socio-ecological crisis, a feeling of despair that is so familiar to Indigenous, Queer and many diaspora communities around the world. When researching about the community I was trying to search for resources that were non-western centered, when something came up called: Futures Literacy (FL) , something I have never heard of but has been around since the beginning of this century. FL is rooted in the notions of \u201cusing the future\u201d. \u201cThe future does not exist in the present but anticipation does. The form the future takes in the present is anticipation.\u201d Using the cross-over of theory and practice of Anticipation Systems (AS), the future is integrated into the present, and that happens constantly trough out our daily-life having the potential of helping us overturn into new frames of mind. For example: Efforts to recognise and preserve cultural heritage, in all its forms, are fundamentally linked to views of the past, present and future. As a result, the anticipatory assumptions that form the foundation for imagining the future play a determinant role in understanding what cultural heritage is, which aspects are deemed worth preserving and how to attempt to assure durability or continuity. I am interested in researching more on FL to redeem colonization and Bayo Akomolafe , the writer and founder of The Emergence Network in Nigeria, has some great thoughts on this topic \u201cColonisation was really about homogenization and mass production. It was also about the sterilization of hope, the failure of imagination, and the condensation of the manifold to a single story.\u201d There are more stories and futures beyond the capitalist, colonizer and industrial imposed ones under the (still) suffocating systems of oppression, there are futures that look like community, unity, abundance, and diversity, which are welcoming and freeing. Those emerging possibilities are the ones I am fighting for. Facilitating To be a facilitator is a role of great responsibility. It is the role of an active listener, mediator, curator, communicator, time manager, open-minded and at the center of everything a great facilitator is a channel of love and tolerance for that particular group. This word was introduced to the class and attached to another concept: Social Capital. As we are all part of a group in relation to something else. That lead us to the final exercise of the week where we embodied a system to better understand it. This is when M\u00e9rce introduced us to Embodied Theatre. With that exercise we explored with our bodies the role of students, politics, citizens, money, governments, research and funding I then explored another topic that I was constantly confroted with in the past related to excellence and expertise (meritocracy systems). No (self) judgment and meritocracy With the time I spent in Scientific institutions, there was an underlying discussion of what is excellence. Excellence has always been viewed as an ally to scientific innovation, but is it really? This is currently a hot topic in scientific institutions. I came across this AEON article that exposes the following thoughts: - rather than excellence a team of people should bring diverse knowledge bases, tools and analytic skills to the table - Optimal hiring depends on context - \u201cgiven a specific task and the composition of a particular team, one would be more likely to contribute than another\u201d \u2018Having people who have different mental perspectives is what\u2019s important. If you want to explore things you haven\u2019t explored, having people who look just like you and think just like you is not the best way.\u2019 - Astro Teller, CEO of X - \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d Mentioned article: Why hiring the best people produces the least creative results But what happens when you have the role of facilitator within an environment that places you in contact with something more-than-human? As we moved into the assignments related to Design Dialogues this particular theme shined the brighter and reminded me of what Ron Wakkary said during his lecture: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to be inclusionary but it is possible to be tentacular and collective in our design.\u201d Since then, together with the group Augmented Creativity - Myrto, Stella, Paige, Mariana and I - decided to join forces to bring in order to explore the following question: How to facilitate interactions with something that is more than human?

Role 1: This would have been a useful approach to a project in the third year of my Biology Bachelor\u2019s degree. For a class on population dynamics, I had the idea to test if the color preference of Harmonia axyridis is sex-dependent, meaning if males and females have the same color preference. In nature, that could translate into high probabilities of finding males and females in the same-colored flowers. It ended up being an inconclusive study, due to many factors, but now I see how I should\u2019ve spent more time prototyping different experimental sets. The set for this experiment consisted of a 30x38cm transparent acrylic box and in each corner, there were different colored sticker paper (yellow, green, blue and red). Insects like Harmonia axyridis have apical tendencies (to visit the apex of branches/buds), even though it was not registered this could be a possible non-detected variable: the colors of the stickers on top of the box vs the colors placed at the basis of the acrylic box. Another example of a non-tested variable is the intensity of the colors. For instance, the chosen colors were very bright and rarely observed in a natural environment, so testing with colors in wavelengths closer to those we find in nature would very likely change the results. Prototyping is a game-changer when it comes to the production of knowledge. Role 4: Often, before new scientific discoveries, there was the development of an instrument or technic that led or allowed the analyses of the phenomena. During my time at a scientific institution, we would recall stories of times when research corroborating a particular hypothesis was highly celebrated vs the development of a new technic. The paradigm has definitely shifted as administration and scientists realized that these technical developments (ex. electric microscopy technics) were as important, enabling meaningful and ground-breaking discoveries by studying a phenomenon with \u201cnew lenses\u201d. Concluding that the documentation of a process is as relevant as the result of a certain research project. If prototypes are designed to capture information relevant to the development of a project, then surveys will serve that purpose, and as someone that worked in science project management, that is something I am familiar with, this relates to Role 2 .

By adding coffee grounds (waste) to the clay the porosity of the material is increased. This might be helpful for certain ecological artifacts, ex. ollas. So I took this opportunity to try and incorporate this element into natural clay as another physical experiment inspired by my digital design space. collect coffee grounds dry the collected coffee grounds (microwaved for 2min.) incorporate into the clay add the necessary water This idea was inspired by the following study: Manni, A., El Haddar, A., El Hassani, I.

The smell of clay, the touch of spikes, the sound of insects, the colors of flowers, etc. all of that contributed to the realization that 1PP is valuable because it enriches research with human senses and humane actions. With the 1PP design, it felt more purpose-driven. I do think I am still very much a Prototype Role 1 kind of designer but I will definitely incorporate a 1PP as valuable input. Why add coffee? By adding coffee grounds (waste) to the clay the porosity of the material is increased. This might be helpful for certain ecological artifacts, ex. ollas. So I took this opportunity to try and incorporate this element into natural clay as another physical experiment inspired by my digital design space. collect coffee grounds dry the collected coffee grounds (microwaved for 2min.) incorporate into the clay add the necessary water This idea was inspired by the following study: Manni, A., El Haddar, A., El Hassani, I. E. E. A., El Bouari, A., & Sadik, C. (2019). Valorization of coffee waste with Moroccan clay to produce a porous red ceramics (class BIII). Bolet\u00edn de la Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Cer\u00e1mica y Vidrio, 58 (5), 211-220. Next Steps\u2026 From this exercise I could derivate 2 more activities: I want to share the clay tablet with kids in the playground, interact and see how they respond (I want to interfere as little as possible, at least in the beginning, even if it means the end of the clay tablet). Because I want to get as much as I can from these leaves, I will do a cyanotype print for some of the leaves (it is also a way to protect the documentation, if the kids in the playground destroy the clay tablet)","title":"Living With Your Ideas"},{"location":"term1/lwyi/02-lwyi/","text":"Living With Your Ideas / COMPANION \u00b6 The Shaker by Carolina Almeida","title":"Companion"},{"location":"term1/lwyi/02-lwyi/#living-with-your-ideas-companion","text":"The Shaker by Carolina Almeida","title":"Living With Your Ideas / COMPANION"},{"location":"term1/tech/fromcoffeetobubbles/","text":"Tech Beyond the Myth \u00b6 From a Coffee Machine to a Bubblemaker We went from imagining the processes of other designers to making an artifact ourselves.

Something that I will only be able to explain in retrospect.","title":"Design Studio 2"},{"location":"term2/digitalprototype/challenge/","text":"MICRO CHALLENGE 1.0 \u00b6 I am always so excited when FabLab meets MDEF because there is a clash of ideas that come to fruition in a matter of days .

I am very interested in decolonizing research. For me that circles back to storytelling, of who is telling the stories, myths, fantasies, and building these worlds and futures.

Yet, they are still celebrated and highly viewed by many. Our History books are broken, as it is the system we currently live in, and that is reflected in our physical world. So, when Marielle came to me with the idea of making a Machine that would uncover these hidden truths around the city of Barcelona, we could not help ourselves from jumping straight into it. Stella join us because she is also interested in the subtle signals/inputs/language a city can give to its citizens and how that shapes someone\u2019s experience and beliefs. By the end of the morning of the first day, after brainstorming, reference searching, and sharing our values, we were set on the idea of making a Museum of Colonization. The Museum of Colonization would be in the city of Barcelona. From defaced little colonizer statues, and making molds of city artifacts, to having a machine that would shoot colonization facts, we combined all of that and concluded that we would make a Gumball machine . This was the initial idea and some of the questions we first had consisted of: Gumball Machine: figuring out the mechanism, designing our system, deciding whether we needed electrical components, designing the exterior of the machine, finding ways of combining the different machine parts (base, cover/top, front, back, mechanism, ball wholes), choosing materials (acrylic, paper, cardboard or wood), Balls: figuring out what kind of material was the best to work with (plastic or paper/cardboard), trying out different ball designs, defining the size of the ball, and trying different cutting technics to make the pattern (vinyl cutter or laser cutter). Gifts: ticket for the museum, stickers with a fact of the colonizer, a mini statue of the colonizer. Due to time constraints, we decided that we would only make the stickers. Without knowing the size of the ball we could not have a mechanism. So, Stella started working on finding how we could make a ball. She is great at visualizing origami patterns and making them her own, so she proceeded with that task until we settled on a particular ball design. While Stella was doing the ball design and testing, I was trying to figure out how gumball machines work. I felt like I had to make a physical mechanical thing, feel, see, and build one to then move with a more spatial and materialistic awareness of what this machine does and consists of. I grabbed some cardboard and made a fast prototype of a mechanical gumball for kids. While I was doing that, Marielle was searching for a code to make our future disk dispenser work. We were working under schedule, and using our different skills to try to make this possible. I was nervous, as when I did the Tech Beyond the Myth the biggest struggle was to make the motor stop when and where we wanted\u2026 Yet, by the end of the day, we had a prototype of the mechanism (disk dispenser) made out of cardboard and decided on what kind of ball we would use - what we now call an armadillo ball. This was just the first day! On the second day , Marielle and I started by brainstorming about the looks of the Machine. This was the combination of symbols, triggers, architecture, and calligraphy that is all around us. From China Town to Angolan traditional villages. Once we settled on a design Marielle moved it to Adobe Illustrator. While Marielle worked on adobe, I was focused on portraying the colonizer\u2019s defaced illustrations and their facts with a different tone. This group is not about feeling emotionally and energetically drained by focusing on colonization, but rather finding healthier and funnier ways to cope with harsh historical facts while still shining a light on the truths behind European cities like Barcelona. I learned so much from Marielle\u2019s and Stella\u2019s skills! We had to be fast and Marielle was super proficient with the software, and Stella could visualize the outcome of the origami balls and adapt them. Before moving our designs into Rhino and laser cutting, we had some more cardboard experiments to do, in order to size the machine according to our ball size foresight. Once we got that out of our way, we moved on to figuring out the best measurements for the slots (places on the base of the machine where we would attach the different parts) according to the length of the component and thickness of the material. We intended to use acrylic and wood. But how could we make wood bend to meet our design choices? Because straight lines are not aligned with our \u201cNon-Western-Centric\u201d futures\u2026 That is when Marielle mentioned a type of cutting pattern that allows for materials like wood, to be more flexible in certain parts. So of course, we had to test it! However, due to time constraints, we chose to not proceed with wood to make our soft-cornered design. But this is what we learned from it: the wood we used was not ideal for laser cutting as it burned very fast and did not cut through the design ou of the designs in the picture of our testing the most flexible way We could not use wood, but we could still use cardboard and attain a great texture and still very bendy. Marielle and Stella due to their backgrounds (Design & Arts) already knew we could have this as an alternative, but I saw it for the first time when I ripped the cardboard, and it looked fitting to our design and intentions. After that, I moved on to electronics as we had to replace Marielle\u2019s Arduino, used for the initial prototype, for an ESP32 because we wanted to use the setup with a battery instead of connected to a PC. While shifting the setup I realized that the code used was done with a particular library I did not have installed, also the board and the setup were having the weirdest reactions, even Adai and Daphne were surprised. For Arduino, Marielle had found the servo.h library that would allow our motor to do a 180\u00ba turn each time, but it was a library incompatible with the ESP32. Daphne helped me find a library that was done with an ESP32 in mind. While I was doing the electronics with the ESP32, Marielle was at the laser cutter and Stella was trying to make the balls more resistant. This is when I started to feel guilty. The first micro-challenge was coming to an end and even though I did help Marielle and Stella, and I was doing different tasks I did not have the chance to spend as much time as I wanted on the laser cut or doing the ball design. I understand now the guilt behind this was a personal construct: thought out school I was very used to being the one doing everything in group projects. In order to finish quite an ambitious project we organically divided our work without much discussion and played with our strengths, which is totally fine if not the best scenario but I am still attached to old habits that haunted me for the last few days\u2026 I later realized that there was no need to feel guilty. I am still learning how experiences, biases, and habits shaped me and that is ok. Day three and we assembled the machine. The slots were the correct ones, and the sizes were in accordance with each piece and the ball size, we had engravings of a logo, the stickers, the balls, and the documentation but we still needed: attach every part of the machine together on the base slots because we were no longer working with wood (that would have slots to fit the acrylic parts) we had to glue the cardboard to the acrylics make a slide for the balls (from the top to the dispenser) pass our notion documentation to a GitHub Repository As we passed through these obstacles we got to see our Museum of Colonization come to life!

Well, microchallenges are a (big) understatement of what this week looked like. The MOC group decided to stick together and make a portable version of the last machine so we could take it on the El Hierro research trip. We used so many skills\u2026 3D printing, electronic hardware set-ups that included a button + LED + speaker + SD card mp3 player + GPS, laser cutting EVA, GPS data retrieval systems, and turned data into information, a more commonly understandable format by translating coordinates into pins on a map! I am so proud of myself and the whole group for pulling this off. The MOC has still the same concept but now it is portable, meaning you can get your \u201cstickers\u201d (or versions of this guerrilla system) anywhere in the world. So, we went from the \u201ccity of Barcelona is the Museum of Colonization\u201d to \u201cthe world is the Museum of Colonization\u201d. It can seem like a careless generalization if one\u2019s fonts of knowledge were only History classes in our sterilized and stiff school curriculums. But, once we get to use some critical thinking and other references, the message is clear. The European expeditions in search of the \u201cNew World\u201d initiated the homogenization of the Globe (cultural, ecological, and racial) and started a globalized network known as the Atlantic Slave Trade. So, yes the MOC is global because colonization is a systemic global problem. So it should be portable\u2026 we thought of low-tech ways tickets might be given out - something like stamps. And, thought of how others could see the dimension of a hypothetical (for now) MOC community - GPS and map visualization. Also wanted to add a bit of fun! So, we incorporated a speaker that was similar to the purpose of the Staples slogan and button \u201cthat is easy\u201d, but saying a different sentence: \u201cthat is so colonial\u201d.

Please check out our GitHub repository to know step by step and the coding behind this machine. Even though we did not manage to fit all the electronics inside the body of the MOC button, later, while preparing Design Dialogues Exhibition II we managed to do so. And, this is what it looks like with all its components. Also, even though we did so much research, trial and error with this MOC Button we still cannot get it to work consistently. It is very frustrating when the code is right, the hardware is well assembled and put together but for some reason it still does not work everytime we need it to. So we have decided not to bring it to El Hierro, Yet, this is not the end of the MOC.

These things do not seem as foreign to me and I am befriending electronics, getting excited about prototyping and viewing software as micro-challenges instead of focusing on expertise. I am happy that we are getting more time to explore the maker\u2019s world and find ways to incorporate some of that knowledge and instruments into our projects. My interests rely on non-western-centric world views and interspecies collaboration, but when it comes to making I am deeply interested in making science more accessible and hacking Biology, not only in access to knowledge sources but also facilities/infrastructures/instruments and the tools used to bring Biology into different spaces. Science is a societal construct that can be proven by mathematical arguments and reproduced through sets of experiments, consequently, its reliability and significance have been settled as our default way of getting to know the unknown, so in the following weeks I hope I can put myself in the shoes of a \u201cmaker\u201d and DIY my way into things that enable other ways of getting to know the world that surrounds us be it trough scientific ways or not. We will see only time can tell what I will come up with. Task 1.0 \u00b6 Until now we have had classes with Victor and Eduardo. And with those knowledge inputs, there were tasks as outputs. As Victor guides us through the basics of Arduino, the selection of boards, the maker community, resources for further explorations, and anything electronics, Task 1.0 is to make our Arduino music with an Arduino board. I was convinced I had forgotten what I learned in previous weeks but not really, I did all the basics without struggling too much: a closed circuit, indicated the right pins in the code, played around with the timing of the music, experimented with different songs and tried to understand the new parts, for example, the piezzo buzzer. This was fun, it seems like I am slowly getting into the right mindset for the Microchallenge week. How piezo buzzer works: One could say that piezo buzzers are made of smart materials that change when voltage is applied, creating sound through the piezzo disk similar to what happens to a speaker\u2019s cone. A source that helped me better understand what this buzzer was: https://www.cuidevices.com/blog/buzzer-basics-technologies-tones-and-driving-circuits Arduinomusic This was the library used to produce the different songs: https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs Task 2.0 \u00b6 Task 2.0 relates to Eduardo\u2019s class on 3D software and modeling. We started small by figuring out what came to mind when the word parametric was in the equation. Does this help us to get to know a three dimension object better? For me, it enabled a more structured and clear view of what lied in front of me or what I wished to build, by caring for its shapes/forms under metric systems. object for the aid of ecological restoration Task 2.1 \u00b6 As Eduardo gave us this next Task simultaneously I opened Rhino as it is widely used software in the Design world and more importantly, the machines in FabLab are compatible with this software. I came to know of its existence only during the pre-course. Needless to say that I no longer remembered 90% of what I\u2019d learned. So, it was a nice surprise to open Rhino for the first time in the last 4 months and not be completely oblivious to some simple functions and tools. Still, I have a long way to go and figure out how to do this particular object I had in my mind - a paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 nest for transplanting plants into terrains that are stripped from life (it looks like a baking form for flan puddings). - I did not finish this task as I intended (having the object fully 3D modeled) but I wish to follow up and I will update this page. Task 3.0 \u00b6 MDEF is good at breaking complex subjects into pieces and making them more approachable. So once the task was set > Sami, Josephine, Jimena and I decided to sit down and figure it out together where half of us would be responsible for the LED setup and the other two for the light sensor setup. Constantly, coming together to situate ourselves in the process and find ways to surpass the obstacles. We had some troubles with it\u2026 but this is how far we got: Morse code with arduino Task 3.1 \u00b6 I was excited about the laser cutting! I did use the small laser cut last week during remixing materials, as Amanda already had used similar machines and so we decided to cut our bioplastic into butterfly shapes using the laser cut machine. This time around I used the medium laser cut machine and got to experiment a bit more with the preparation of the file. Selected some fabric pictures > kapulana (Angola), pano di terra (Cabo Verde), Bogolan mudcloth (Mali) narrowed it down to specific shapes and simplified forms used Inkscape to translate images into vectors passed it to Rhino Once I passed the file to Rhino, the lines were duplicated and \u201ccrooked\u201d. With the help of Ahmed, I then traced the patterns and transformed them into 2D drawings and joined polylines. These were the results: Laser cut patterns Assignment Week 2 \u00b6 This week we had to learn how to scan, 3D print and make a network (electronics). We did the Network class with Victor and the 3D & scan class with Eduardo. I am glad their enthusiasm is contagious because these themes are outside my bubble of interest, of course they are connectable and I am sure future me will have make sense of it all for the 2 nd Microchallenge, but for now I trust their energetic way of sharing knowledge. Task 4.0 - Networking \u00b6 Victor starts by asking: \u201cWhat is a network?\u201d. The class is shy, it sounds like a tricky question\u2026 We are constantly networking but not in the way Victor intended\u2026 Someone answers, \u201cconnections\u201d and I though something similar. But, in the electronic sphere \u201cis all about copies so one can receive what others have, creating a way of communicating between each other. Historically we felt the need to create networks to move information from one place to another. Basically, to do the same thing in parallel through copies.\u201d jumps Victor proceeded to give us a class of how information jumps, bounces and can even be encrypted through making these leaps more frequent. We talked about the undersea optic cables, how the jumps consume greats amounts of energy, the historic value of networks and how that is linked to current ways of communicating ex. WhatsApp. And by the end of the class, as a Task we had to do our own Network so we could communicate with each other. Copy of object for the aid of ecological restoration Task 4.1 - Scan & 3D print \u00b6 First and foremost, 3D printing is an additive way of manufacturing that can save lots of material if we are thoughtful in our design. Jackpot! Some would say, yet the industry still relays on industrial design. Eduardo, gave us an extensive class on the history, machines, file types&formats, file preparation, softwares, slicing and gave a panoply of examples for each case that illustrated the different uses, applications, and emerging technologies being applied in this field.

These things do not seem as foreign to me and I am befriending electronics, getting excited about prototyping and viewing software as micro-challenges instead of focusing on expertise. I am happy that we are getting more time to explore the maker\u2019s world and find ways to incorporate some of that knowledge and instruments into our projects. My interests rely on non-western-centric world views and interspecies collaboration, but when it comes to making I am deeply interested in making science more accessible and hacking Biology, not only in access to knowledge sources but also facilities/infrastructures/instruments and the tools used to bring Biology into different spaces. Science is a societal construct that can be proven by mathematical arguments and reproduced through sets of experiments, consequently, its reliability and significance have been settled as our default way of getting to know the unknown, so in the following weeks I hope I can put myself in the shoes of a \u201cmaker\u201d and DIY my way into things that enable other ways of getting to know the world that surrounds us be it trough scientific ways or not.

I was convinced I had forgotten what I learned in previous weeks but not really, I did all the basics without struggling too much: a closed circuit, indicated the right pins in the code, played around with the timing of the music, experimented with different songs and tried to understand the new parts, for example, the piezzo buzzer. This was fun, it seems like I am slowly getting into the right mindset for the Microchallenge week.

To design for today\u2019s world is to design in the context of permanent uncertainty. Open to be constantly humbled by the events that are rushing and overflowing everywhere, expanding and crushing at different time scales. What I intend to introduce is: all aspects of existence are interconnected and designers should serve the futures of the world by remaining grounded in the construction of the present moment and their local realities. I aim to discuss why to make sense and meaningful contributions, designers must remain aware of and informed by the past, assuring that participants/communities get to transmit their \u201ctorch\u201d into that design form (whatever it is) in ways that respect, honor and fulfill their true needs and wants.

This principle is simple but historically complex: respect life and culture. Only by integrating a multitude of knowledge/perspectives can designers craft suitable presents for this century\u2019s big challenges and heal the imagination of Futures. To better understand how that can come to fruition, and how I can be an active member of this transition, I will attempt to answer the following questions based on \u201cMaking Sense and Meaning\u201d lectures and debates, and on the class readings. What are extraction systems? What are the roots of extraction systems? How are these systems affecting life? How design can reconfigure systems of extraction? With what tools are we building the present and future? Who has access to today\u2019s tools? Which worlds can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? Who gets to be a designer of worlds and futures? (or who do we see as designers) How can we design the transition toward these worlds? 1 - What are systems of extraction? I will start by exemplifying what we discussed as systems of extraction followed by a short take on the concept. Examples: fossil fuel industry, mining, transatlantic slave trade, digital slavery, intense agriculture, intense fishing, ecological imperialism, cultural appropriation, unpaid care, and domestic work, etc. Attached to these examples there is a strong feeling of who and what is being targeted by this system: nature, the poor, women, indigenous and people of color. Systems of extraction exhaust some to add value to others. A system of extraction is a parasitic relationship, a very unbalanced exchange, where one side is stripped so the other side can overflow with resources for its own and individual profit. For these systems to function, the exploited must be cared for just enough to keep sustaining the exploiters. 2 - What are the roots of the systems of extraction? Colonization. In other words, the homogenization of everything according to the European imagination and stories. The moment in which we stand was designed through several decision-making processes highly influenced by a specific story. The story we are currently living says the following: Anthropocene. We are reshaping life as we know it, with serious consequences for everything, as we irreversibly damage the climate and live in an ecological emergency state. Our naming of the era as Anthropocene is rooted in a mindset doomed to create dissociation and release of responsibility - \u201cthe nature of mankind\u201d, it is what it is - rather than saying this is the Capitalocene - a human construction that can be deconstructed -. An era made from improving the design of life\u2019s exploitation, which is a web of interactions woven from feudalism, eco-apartheid, slavery, and capitalism. The subliminal message in these rooted interactions and processes is: \u201cthe promise of wealth through conquest.\u201d Capitalism is a physical manifestation of this belief system, penetrating the web of life through violent and exploitative ways. 3 - How are these systems affecting life? \u201cProduction crashed, and investors found greater returns from large-scale slave-planted sugar whose processing was fueled by forests in the New World. Europe\u2019s wealthy ate the sugar, and sugar ate the island.\u201d Our reality is entangled and non-linear generating intricate and resilient systems. However, the thirst to sustain growth through linear thinking without regard for the entangled world destroys our natural systems. Capitalism is 500 years old. Europe was draining its resources. Because it could no longer survive on its ruined land it moved on to conquering other lands by force. The history we are telling leaves out the acknowledgment of the people native to the lands. The resources of the South Global became an excuse and gateway for colonial expansion and justification. In these cases, the (forced) sharing of local knowledge with outsiders was the very thing that made colonization successful. Colonizers relied upon the knowledge and labor of the native peoples to successfully colonize their lands. This pattern of destroying ecosystems and communities in the name of growth and progress is related to the concept of ecological imperialism, something we continue to see today. Endless growth is not sustainable in a world of finite resources. We must nurture the resilience of our communities and ecosystems rather than crushing them in the name of expansion and accumulation. 4 - How design can reconfigure systems of extraction? In our most recent conversation, Sudebi said: \u201cThe biggest obstacle to documentation is the colonization of imagination.\u201d I agree with this statement, and I have an example that illustrates this. Kianda is an Angolan water mythological creature. This creature was never described or seen as half woman and half fish, like the Geek mermaid myths. However, after colonization by the Portuguese, Kianda is now often seen as a mermaid. This phenomenon happens constantly across different colonized cultures. I believe it is possible to redesign these tendencies by intentionally creating spaces for people to tell their stories on their terms. Ultimately, \u201cwe should aim not only to incorporate fairness and dignity into design practices but to design fairness and dignity itself\u201d , also a thought Sudebi shared with the class. Many of our current problems are systemic and invisible, perpetuating oppression. We must embrace participatory design to uncover and dismantle them. This requires a form of Metafacilitation, which involves facilitating the facilitation to uncover these systems of oppression. The reclaiming of traditional ways of life and sacred millet crops by Zimbabwean communities ( 2 ) is a fantastic example of how decolonization can be put into action. It is possible to resist and challenge the damaging effects of colonization on storytelling, mythmaking, and other aspects of culture. 5 - With what tools are we building the present and future? \u201cMoney is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans, because it is the only story that everybody believes in. Not everybody believes in God, human rights or nationalism, but everybody believes in money, in the dollar bill.\u201d - Yuval Noah There are many ways to approach the concept of \u201ctools,\u201d which can be seen as prosthetics that aid living beings. Tools can take various forms, from our voices, country borderlines, drugs, and books to artificial intelligence, laser cutters, or even something such as a data retrieval system. However, out of all the tools available, storytelling is arguably the most impactful. When a large number of people believe in a story, it creates a network of collaborators and new tools are created to aid their story. This level of collaboration is uniquely human; we trust people we don\u2019t know simply because they share our beliefs. Individually we are an animal like any other, but collectively we rule the world. 6 - Who has access to today\u2019s tools? \u201cWe are not limited by the resources but our imagination\u201d - Beno Juarez What happens when even our imagination and stories have been colonized? The tools will only reflect those human beliefs and narratives. Local people are forced to let go of their traditional ways to move on to what is seen as proper by the colonizer, an outsider trying to govern life to make a profit. With emerging tools like ChatGPT, we can already see tendencies of benefiting some versus others. In a class debate, Amanda mentioned that she uses an American VPN and when the rest of us were having trouble accessing ChatGPT, she could enter the platform with no delay. Once we start thinking of who is training the algorithms things like Amazon\u2019s mechanical turkers pop up. I am more concerned about the fact that not everyone has access to these tools or the ability to use them. As a result, there are already emerging worlds and futures being designed without the input of certain communities and perspectives. Let\u2019s take the example of open-source data. Cities like Barcelona have open data on air pollution, traffic, parking spots, and urban biodiversity even though it is open it is not accessible to most people to transform that data into information, so the individuals or entities able to use that information are being privileged. Data, too, has no perfect way of retrieving it, and is not immune to bias, whether due to human error or the limitations of human-made tools. 7 - Which worlds can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? During the talks \u201cMaking Sense and Meaning\u201d we were collectively imagining these worlds and it lead to amazing insights into different approaches to design with and for communities. For this question, I can only conclude that I cannot answer this alone, if I did I would be lacking in such a deep way because I believe we can only design futures collectively. I could say that I do see a future where we embrace different cultures, do not take more than we give or need, co-live harmoniously with other beings, and where technology can be used carefully and intentionally. This to say that the possibilities of what we can design with today\u2019s tools are only limited by our imagination and willingness to work together towards a shared vision \u00f3f a better future. 8 - Who gets to be a designer of worlds and futures? (or who do we see as designers) Those with the power to shape the stories that people believe in also have access to the most powerful tools. However, BIPOC people and marginalized folks keep on designing the most incredible solutions from their localized knowledge and materials. The design revolution is continuously happening all around us by people that do not even recognize such things as design. By recognizing the value of indigenous and native design thinking, we can broaden our understanding of what design is and where it comes from. Once again \u201cwe are not limited by resources but by our imagination\u201d. By cultivating the imagination of FutureS, we can work towards realities that include non-formal designers and prioritize mutual aid and cooperation. 9 - How can we design the transition towards these worlds? I believe many of us are already engaging in this transition. How could I say otherwise after listening to Tomas Diez, Frederick van Amstel, Beno Juarez, Sudebi Thakurata, and Felencia Hutabarat. Through these discussions and further readings, I see how the world around us is based on someone else\u2019s vision of the future, fiction. While some advocate for a world where individuals use local resources to create their products, others aim to achieve riches through fast fashion business models. However, it\u2019s essential to recognize that each approach has significant implications for our collective future, and the choices we make today will shape the world we live in for years to come. I see the way forward through Sankofa and mutual aid, where we work collaboratively to reclaim what has been lost. When I asked Beno how we could give back to indigenous and marginalized people from whose teachings we learn about building community, circularity, spiral, and regenerative practices, his simple yet profound response was to \u201clearn their language.\u201d This highlights the importance of learning to speak the language of those who\u2019ve never seen themselves as something apart from Nature and are the very embodiment of interconnectedness. They do not use the same westernized and intellectual vocabulary nor do they have to, we should learn with their ways. As we join the fight towards a more conscious future I can\u2019t help but be deeply humbled by the tacit knowledge of everyone around me and design is just that: the physical manifestation of the culture, stories, and knowledge of the living things on this planet.","title":"Essay"},{"location":"term2/makingsense/essay/#making-sense-and-meaning","text":"Do you want us to learn what you are telling us?\u201d I hesitated a moment, but he rushed on with, \u201cOr is it all a sort of example, an illustration of something else?\u201d \u201cYes, indeed!\u201d.

By recognizing the value of indigenous and native design thinking, we can broaden our understanding of what design is and where it comes from. Once again \u201cwe are not limited by resources but by our imagination\u201d. By cultivating the imagination of FutureS, we can work towards realities that include non-formal designers and prioritize mutual aid and cooperation. 9 - How can we design the transition towards these worlds? I believe many of us are already engaging in this transition. How could I say otherwise after listening to Tomas Diez, Frederick van Amstel, Beno Juarez, Sudebi Thakurata, and Felencia Hutabarat. Through these discussions and further readings, I see how the world around us is based on someone else\u2019s vision of the future, fiction. While some advocate for a world where individuals use local resources to create their products, others aim to achieve riches through fast fashion business models. However, it\u2019s essential to recognize that each approach has significant implications for our collective future, and the choices we make today will shape the world we live in for years to come. I see the way forward through Sankofa and mutual aid, where we work collaboratively to reclaim what has been lost. When I asked Beno how we could give back to indigenous and marginalized people from whose teachings we learn about building community, circularity, spiral, and regenerative practices, his simple yet profound response was to \u201clearn their language.\u201d This highlights the importance of learning to speak the language of those who\u2019ve never seen themselves as something apart from Nature and are the very embodiment of interconnectedness. They do not use the same westernized and intellectual vocabulary nor do they have to, we should learn with their ways. As we join the fight towards a more conscious future I can\u2019t help but be deeply humbled by the tacit knowledge of everyone around me and design is just that: the physical manifestation of the culture, stories, and knowledge of the living things on this planet.","title":"Making Sense and Meaning"},{"location":"term2/remixmaterials/assignment/","text":"Remixing materials \u00b6 Assignement 1 st week of Remixing Materials Properties (functional, technical & emotional) - Functional: structural, light, brown, dry, stiff. - Technical: Eatable, compostable, biodegradable, fibrous.

So we can arrange naturally occurring materials to fit our modern needs/wants. The focus was on the research and exploration of alternatives for the replacement of plastic and petroleum-based materials that are the source of so many socio-ecological issues. But is plastic bad if it has served us so well, or is the way we use it that is problematic? What are the ethical concerns of working with living organisms, like mycelium? What protocols should be followed when working in a BioLab that engineers new materials? We explored these questions and many more. Key-words: Living Material, Material Biomimicry, Material Tinkering, Material Geography Introduction to the Mycelium world at Sbiotica, with Jessica Dias. Working with living materials can build an understanding of and respect for materials as living nature, optimize the use of material resources and thus build more resilient systems. Furthermore, as production will depend on the materials growing, it can strengthen slow design thinking for designers and users. (Hasling M. K., R\u00e6bild U., Herttua I., Patel A., Material Pathways. Narrating materials in design for sustainability (tool). Design School Kolding, 2020.) Mycelium is a material that is a living organism or a living organism that is a material. Designers use their innate growth behavior to create alternative products or processes that are less harmful to the health of the people and planet. It is interesting how a mycelium product is part of the anthropomorphic version of a fungi\u2019s life cycle, by depending on laboratory materials. We are making a sustainable alternative material using tools and similar scientific facilities that depend on the use of metals and single-use plastics. As we democratize bio-labs and bio-engineering tools become more accessible there is going to be a boom in scientific waste. It makes me wonder, what does a sustainable or circular bio-lab looks like? Week 2 - abstract/summary We are truly working in the Anthropocene, using living materials, biological compounds and technology to design better ways of living and letting live. The material explorations continue with the introduction of new machines and technics - 3D printing & molding. In the case of my group, we also explored the laser cutter in FabLab. We went through the motions of more questioning: What is 3D printing? What biomaterials can be used? We tried to explore different protocols, recipes, changing parameters and the variables that accompany the use of a 3D printer. The class was divided into groups to print objects made of remixed materials or clay. Later, together with Edu and Petra, the class was introduced to the basics of mold making and bacteria dyeing. Keywords: Material Tinkering, Material Datasheets, Manufacturing, Molding, 3D printing. MATERIAL by Carolina Almeida The group explorations were the core and the fuel of the week, producing knowledge and materializing our design spaces. I was in a duo with Amanda Jarvis. Amanda gifted me with the most interesting facts on the maker world, costume design and textiles. We found out that our interests intersected and shined the brightest when we discussed holistic approaches to material design, critical thinking, and boycotting capitalistic and neoliberal structures which in the context of Remixing Materials led us into color and pigment development. We tried to make bioplastics work as biograffiti prototypes while also applying these explorations as textile adornments (for example sequins). For the development of materials, we would always have pigment incorporation. The pigment extraction was made from Itnig\u2019s coffee waste.
