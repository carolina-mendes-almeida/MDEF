And, once we saw the Petri boxes full of textures, reflections, colors and life, more questions popped up: How many types of organisms are on the Petri box? Were they all part of the microbiome of the bug or the basil leaf? Should I make more mediums to isolate each colony of bacteria? Do I have any of these microorganisms within me? How different am I from them? If they are the least complex out of the 3 biological domains, why do they seem so well organized? How can I contribute to their well-being? Can I ally with these beings? Two months ago, in The New Yorker printed issue of 15 th of August, Jill Lepore\u2019s comment was published with the title: \u201cBringing Back the Woolly Mammoth: Americans have long understood the species\u2019 extinction as a warning. But is trying to \u201cde-extinct\u201d it really a good idea?\u201d. Mammoths ( Mammuthus sp. ) were part of the megafauna of the Pleistocene. They were herbivorous mammals that inhabited big areas from cold tundra steppe, arid grasslands, to temperate savanna-parklands, thanks to paleontological records scientists were able to identify different species and morphologies that enabled Mammuthus sp. to survive in these different environments (Enk J. et al., 2016). Now, with biotechnological advancements, companies like Colossal, work to bring back mammoths to recover lost ecological functions that could mitigate climate change. The plan, as Jill wrote, is for de-extinct mammoths to \u201cpopulate the permafrost and avert its melting by turning wet tundra into dry grasslands, which better sequester carbon and reflect sunlight, keeping the permafrost cooler and helping, thereby, to save the planet.\u201d It is important to keep the permafrost because these soil layers are often wet as well as cold, affecting oxidation/reduction, decomposition, and other biogeochemical processes. Storing organic matter underneath it since the Pleistocene (Ping C. et al., 2015). Zimov, N. S. et al. (2005) presented scenarios suggesting a rapid release of tens of kg C m2 when permafrost disappears. They also explored a solution: replacing the arid regions of Eastern Siberia (mossy forests and tundra dominated) with productive grasslands and abundant herbivorous animals. This transition could have effects on energy exchange strong enough, to reduce permafrost temperature and methane emission, allowing accumulation of tens of kg C m2. With the death of the mammoth came the extinction of a habitat: Mammoth Steppe a distinctive, now-vanished biome dominated by large mammal grazers (Wang, Y. et al., 2021) So, this is why this species is the Colossal\u2019s first choice of de-extinction as a climate change mitigation solution, the mammoth could enable the transition from tundra to the mammoth steppe. Creative and new solutions like this become more urgent with today\u2019s climate crisis. Governments are failing us and \u201ctrends in biodiversity have been declining and are projected to continue to do so\u201d (2020, Global Biodiversity Outlook 5). We need to keep looking for innovative ways of tackling this global issue, but is de-extinction the way to go? This last paragraph established a \u201cwhy\u201d, yet the questions keep coming. Jill, wrote that Colossal is planning on bringing the first mammoth calves by 2025. But where? We don\u2019t have the mammoth biome of 10.000 years ago and we will need it because once the technical hurdles of creating viable offspring of extinct animals are overcome, the species becomes a reintroduction candidate (J\u00f8rgensen D. et al.,2013). And we still do not agree on what the ultimate extinction cause of mammoths was (Lorenzen et al., 2011; Nikolskiy et al., 2011). It leaves us with more questions: Would it be a meaningful addiction to the local ecosystems? Could it regenerate the mammoth steppe or would it just worsen the condition of the current? What will the genetic pools of this mammoth population look like? Would they have evolutionary resistance? Before attempting de-extinction we should carefully access reintroduction parameters, as we cannot bring a living creature back to a non-existent habitat or one it cannot survive. But, let\u2019s say we do manage to have the habitat, then ultimately the success of the reintroduction would depend on their genetic arrangement and resilience to the current abiotic and biotic human-induced changes. Yet, even if Colossal manages to fill the genetic gaps in the mammoth genome it will be very difficult to secure the sustainability of a population with such little genetic material. The result would be low genetic variation within the population and increased inbreeding. There can also be undetected consequences beyond genetics for example epigenetics, behavior care or transmission of the microbiome, inputs very difficult to obtain if it was created in a biotechnological experiment or raised by other species (Robert a. et al, 2017). Unfortunately, I recognize these discontinuations as ingredients for an extinction vortex, putting the mammoth in line for its second-time extinction. I would also like to highlight that de-extinction is a great name for marketing and getting funds as it signifies undoing extinction when in reality Colossal is attempting to create a hybrid of an Asian Elephant that has cold resistance, smaller ears, fur and a thicker layer of fat, so it can withstand the cold of the tundra and fulfill its ecological role. This is not de-extinction, this is CRISPR-Cas9 enabling genetic improvements, because in the end once the extinction line is crossed you cannot undo it. And, this is the tip of the iceberg because I haven\u2019t even remotely touched the cultural or socioeconomic reality. One of the reasons conservation initiatives can fail is because of a lack of context, and species reintroduction is a conservation technic. The socioeconomic implications of the project have to be properly assessed as \u201chuman acceptance of reintroduction projects will be a crucial aspect to consider for de-extinction\u201d (J\u00f8rgensen, D. et al., 2013). And even if everything from the DNA editing to the populating of the permafrost works out, there are still bioethical questions needing answers: Does Colossal own these animals? What does this mean for the Nagoya Protocol? Are we going to have mammoth hamburgers and themed parks? As J\u00f8rgensen D. (2013) said de-extinction is not simply an intermediate between reintroduction and invasion, but much can be learned from case studies on these topics. There are issues of de-extinction that we are familiar with due to other conservation projects, but there is a dark side to the moon that we are not able to foresee. This is so innovative, some argue is parallel to the moon landing, but I agree with Jill\u2019s comment it makes almost no sense; it\u2019s too little, too late. It is great to entertain billionaires but as an innovative climate change solution\u2026 too late. My opinion changes when it comes to recently extinct species as, in the case of reintroductions, times between local extinction and the planned release range from a few years to a few 100 years, the levels of divergence between the environment and a de-extinct population would be less intense than the 4.000 year mammoth gap (Robert a. et al, 2017). How we answer these questions has the potential of shaping our biomes and the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere, but one thing about scientists, they don\u2019t stop in the face of adversity they thrive in these challenging environments. In the time spare, I can only hope the 75 million dollars invested in this company will help develop new scientific technics in genomics that could help us in different areas (from health to conservation). \u201cIt\u2019s a similar kind of ambitious, engineering-focused, team-based target that President Kennedy set when he declared we would put a person on the moon within a decade. The scientific challenges of this project are considerable but ultimately surmountable. The bioethical dimensions are paramount. The execution will no doubt be daunting.

I learned so much from all the communities we came in contact with as well from reminiscing on past experiences and my connection with the African diaspora. It was also a great way to reflect on spaces where this unity is lacking and how we ignite the facilitator role. Key-words: Community, Engagement, Listening, Power, Invisibility, Inequality, Diversity, Representation, Mapping, Togetherness, Action, Money, Power, Facilitating, Conflict Management, Futures Literacy. Community Mapping If Biology only makes sense in the light of evolution, Community mapping only makes sense under the perspective of Complex Systems. That is exactly what we practised with Markel with the united kigdom map of the obesity problem that included a great number of factors, from transportation systems and infrastructure to psychological factors. Power Dynamics When talking about community, as oneness and togetherness, it feels like we have set an intention of acting towards a greater good. Yes, you can recycle, compost, go vegan, or zero-waste but to do so embedded in a community is empowering and establishes stronger bonds - a blueprint for societal change. There is power in numbers. This takes us to what was tackled later in the week: power. I believe I have power but most of the time I am unaware of how much. After coming across the following papers: 1) \u201cThe P-Word: Power aversion and responsibility aversion as explanations for the avoidance of power\u201d; 2) \u201cWho Wants to Get to the Top? Class and Lay Theories About Power\u201d, my view on power changed as I realized that my background (mixed race woman and raised in a family of immigrants), values and principles constrained my views, search and the notion of power. In summary, these papers speak about how some communities, especially those on the margins of society, do not actively search for positions of power and even avoided it, by thinking it is inherently negative (something I related to). So why do individuals from lower classes don\u2019t seek power as avidly as higher class individuals? Low class individuals are less interested in seeking positions of power using political means, and as a result less interested in seeking positions of power more broadly; They perceive that for advancement you need to play politics, so they then fail to pursue advancement and further contribute to their low status; There is inner conflict, lower class individuals tend to focus on the community more than on themselves clashing with some concepts of pursuing positions of power in politics; But there are two particular situations where low class individuals are as interested in acquiring positions of power as individuals from higher classes: \u201cwhen advancement comes explicitly from prosocial means rather than from political means and to some extent when they frame power as a superordinate other-focused goal\u201d. It highlights how difficult but how necessary it is to have class-based diversity within power positions. The community-driven professional goals of BIPOC folks are well represented in this example given by Neil deGrasse (Astrophysicist) when one of his (black) friends says: \u201cAstrophysics? The black community cannot afford the luxury of someone of your intellect to spend it on that subject.\u201d Making him feel guilty about not doing enough to help others. You can watch the full video here: A Story About Race Neil deGrasse Tyson - YouTube . Not to say that every BIPOC struggle is due our conception of power, it is much more complex, but it is freeing to detach evilness from power and move forward without that guilt. Representation and Diversity Just like sustainability, these words are thrown around every day. But what does it mean to have representation and diversity within a group of people? It means to consciously open space to those who have been marginalized by society (at different levels), it\u2019s creating equal opportunities through equity,\u2026 And there is the need to actively do so! We have to be intentional in opening these spaces because historically, for centuries, there were intentional acts of discrimination that led to generational consequences, keeping these groups under the tight and inhumane grip of exploitation, translating into a societal system that has roots in colonization, capitalism, and ecological destruction. Also, it is a fact that diversity is a driver of innovation, creativity, and productivity. The \u201cwhy\u201d is settled, but \u201chow\u201d is the million dollar question. I was the 1 black student in 300 students at my Bachelor\u2019s in Biology (Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon). If, any of the professors opened a job/intern opportunity no matter how inclusive they would like to be the chances of that person being BIPOC was 1/300. There is so much resistance in the current system to open space to unprivileged and marginalized groups in higher education. So, clearly, something happens before college because 1/300 it is not representative of the BIPOC population interested in life sciences (Lisbon - Portugal), and I believe that institutions that produce new knowledge and are aiming to lead a new generation of free thinkers must have this subject as one of their higher priorities: the inclusion of BIPOC, Queer and LGBTQ+, People with disabilities, cognitive and background diversity.

When researching about community I was trying to search for resources that were non-western centered, when something came up called: Futures Literacy (FL) , something I have never heard of but has been around since the beginning of this century. FL is rooted in the notions of \u201cusing-the-future\u201d. \u201cThe future does not exist in the present but anticipation does. The form the future takes in the present is anticipation.\u201d Using the cross-over of theory and practise of Anticipation Systems (AS), the future is integrated in the present, and that happens constantly trough out our daily-life having the potential of helping us overturn into new frames of mind. For example: Efforts to recognise and preserve cultural heritage, in all its forms, are fundamentally linked to views of the past, present and future. As a result, the anticipatory assumptions that form the foundation for imagining the future play a determinant role in understanding what cultural heritage is, which aspects are deemed worth preserving and how to attempt to assure durability or continuity. I am interest in researching more on FL to redeem colonization and Bayo Akomolafe , the writer and founder of The Emergence Network in Nigeria , has some great thoughts on this topic \u201cColonisation was really about homogenization and mass production. It was also about the sterilization of hope, the failure of imagination, and the condensation of the manifold to a single story.\u201d There are more stories and futures beyond the captalist, colonizer and industrial imposed ones under the (still) suffocating systems of opression, there are futures that look like community, unity, abundance, diversity, are welcoming and freeing. Those emerging possibilities are the ones I am fighting for. Facilitating To be a facilitator is a role of great responsibility. It is the role of a active listener, mediator, curator, communicator, time-manager, open-minded and at the center of everything a great facilitator is a channel of love and tolerance for that particular group. This word was introduced to the class attached to another concept: Social Capital . **** As we are all part of a group in relation to something else.

Even though I have never designed, some of the prototype roles sounded familiar. Bellow, I describe how I came in contact with them, even before I knew of their existence. Role 1: This would have been a useful approach to a project in the third year of my Biology Bachelor\u2019s degree. For a class on population dynamics, I had the idea to test if the color preference of Harmonia axyridis is sex-dependent, meaning if males and females have the same color preference. In nature, that could translate into high probabilities of finding males and females in the same-colored flowers. It ended up being an inconclusive study, due to many factors, but now I see how I should\u2019ve spent more time prototyping different experimental sets. The set for this experiment consisted of a 30x38cm transparent acrylic box and in each corner, there were different colored sticker paper (yellow, green, blue and red). Insects like Harmonia axyridis have apical tendencies (to visit the apex of branches/buds), even though it was not registered this could be a possible non-detected variable: the colors of the stickers on top of the box vs the colors placed at the basis of the acrylic box. Another example of a non-tested variable is the intensity of the colors. For instance, the chosen colors were very bright and rarely observed in a natural environment, so testing with colors in wavelengths closer to those we find in nature would very likely change the results. Prototyping is a game-changer when it comes to the production of knowledge. Role 4: Often, before new scientific discoveries, there was the development of an instrument or technic that led or allowed the analyses of the phenomena. During my time at a scientific institution, we would recall stories of times when research corroborating a particular hypothesis was highly celebrated vs the development of a new technic. The paradigm has definitely shifted as administration and scientists realized that these technical developments (ex. electric microscopy technics) were as important, enabling meaningful and ground-breaking discoveries by studying a phenomenon with \u201cnew lenses\u201d. Concluding that the documentation of a process is as relevant as the result of a certain research project.

Even though I have never designed, some of the prototype roles sounded familiar. Bellow, I describe how I came in contact with them, even before I knew of their existence. Role 1: This would have been a useful approach to a project in the third year of my Biology Bachelor\u2019s degree. For a class on population dynamics, I had the idea to test if the color preference of Harmonia axyridis is sex-dependent, meaning if males and females have the same color preference. In nature, that could translate into high probabilities of finding males and females in the same-colored flowers. It ended up being an inconclusive study, due to many factors, but now I see how I should\u2019ve spent more time prototyping different experimental sets. The set for this experiment consisted of a 30x38cm transparent acrylic box and in each corner, there were different colored sticker paper (yellow, green, blue and red). Insects like Harmonia axyridis have apical tendencies (to visit the apex of branches/buds), even though it was not registered this could be a possible non-detected variable: the colors of the stickers on top of the box vs the colors placed at the basis of the acrylic box. Another example of a non-tested variable is the intensity of the colors. For instance, the chosen colors were very bright and rarely observed in a natural environment, so testing with colors in wavelengths closer to those we find in nature would very likely change the results. Prototyping is a game-changer when it comes to the production of knowledge. Role 4: Often, before new scientific discoveries, there was the development of an instrument or technic that led or allowed the analyses of the phenomena. During my time at a scientific institution, we would recall stories of times when research corroborating a particular hypothesis was highly celebrated vs the development of a new technic. The paradigm has definitely shifted as administration and scientists realized that these technical developments (ex. electric microscopy technics) were as important, enabling meaningful and ground-breaking discoveries by studying a phenomenon with \u201cnew lenses\u201d. Concluding that the documentation of a process is as relevant as the result of a certain research project. If prototypes are designed to capture information relevant to the development of a project, then surveys will serve that purpose, and as someone that worked in science project management, that is something I am familiar with, this relates to Role 2 . Also, another role I used before is Role 3 , while proposing the construction of a space for visitors at science exhibitions.

It was empowering as I was quite oblivious to the reality of the tech industry. I had been twirling inside these systems unaware of their imposed blockages on the consumers in a weird state were I was the owner of the techonologies but only until a the tech company allowed me to be. I did not think of my rights as a tech consumer, until now. I am glad I questioned, pushed myself and deep dived into what Victor, Guillem, Eduardo and Santi thaught us. The ups and downs were constant and of great amplitude! It was a roller coaster and I wouldn\u2019t change anything. What follows this introduction is just a glimpse of what happened with some extra commentary at the end. 7/11 - 18/11 week by Carolina Almeida The Forensic Report details how we disassemble the coffee machine, why its designers made some odd choices (ex: bulky outwear and small hardware, materiality); patent and history of the artifact; assumptions and reality and our final thoughts and conclusions about the object as a reflection of another decade. Sadly, the current power systems hold companies and the capitalist mentalities as their higher interests. However, there is power in knowing this. The system and the biased algorithms are games that can be played for the greater good. On the 9 th of November, I visited CCCB for a screening of Ex-Machina by Alex Garland and a commentary by Ana Freire. Ex-Machina is a movie I cannot recommend enough, but the commentary by Ana Freire (PhD in Computer Engineering, lecturer and researcher at Pompeu Fabra University) opened my horizons. Ana is leading the STOP project (Suicide prevenTion in sOcial Platforms), \u201cthe objective of this project is to apply Artificial Intelligence to social media data to discover suicide-related patterns: suicide ideation, depression, and eating disorders. We explore behavioral, relational, and multimodal data extracted from social media and develop machine learning models to detect risk patterns.
