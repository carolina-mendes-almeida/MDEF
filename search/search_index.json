It was amazing! To play a game by scanning connections through societal triggers was like making sense of the chaos in 30min. At the same time, we were collecting vocabulary to speak our interests into existence. I see how this can be helpful when mapping/looking for partners, as it is easier to find your \u201ctribe\u201d when you know the words they go by. From the AoWS deck, we used 3 types of cards: 1) Weak Signals; 2) Areas of opportunity; 3) Random Triggers. To get familiar with the game logic we started by taking out random cards and trying to make sense of it all. On my first try these were the cards I had to connect for a hypothetical design intervention/project: Weak Signals Long-terminism Disrupt ageism Random Triggers Food/Agro computing Farm Academy Areas of opportunity Cities My thought process: Ageism is caused by not accepting life cycles. People tend to focus on the outside rather than the inside. Solution: Make an inwards shift, take care of the inside Long-Terminism can be integrated by helping to disrupt ageism through different generations. For example, from mother to daughter and so on. Food and farming can be our tools to get to the end goal of building a better relationship with our own life cycle by being surrounded by nature and respecting food/plants/ and their natural life cycles. Cities are where the relationship with nature is the most fragile and distant. The outcome of the 1 st launch of cards: Let\u2019s create spaces in cities where people can break the mold of ageism for themselves and future generations.","title":"Card Experiment"},{"location":"term1/aws/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"For the introduction to the card game Atlas of Weak Signals (AoWS) Mariana Quintero took us to Jardin de las Mariposas (near IAAC).

Even though I have never designed, some of the prototype roles sounded familiar. Bellow, I describe how I came in contact with them, even before I knew of their existence. Role 1: This would have been a useful approach to a project in the third year of my Biology Bachelor\u2019s degree. For a class on population dynamics, I had the idea to test if the color preference of Harmonia axyridis is sex-dependent, meaning if males and females have the same color preference. In nature, that could translate into high probabilities of finding males and females in the same-colored flowers. It ended up being an inconclusive study, due to many factors, but now I see how I should\u2019ve spent more time prototyping different experimental sets. The set for this experiment consisted of a 30x38cm transparent acrylic box and in each corner, there were different colored sticker paper (yellow, green, blue and red). Insects like Harmonia axyridis have apical tendencies (to visit the apex of branches/buds), even though it was not registered this could be a possible non-detected variable: the colors of the stickers on top of the box vs the colors placed at the basis of the acrylic box. Another example of a non-tested variable is the intensity of the colors. For instance, the chosen colors were very bright and rarely observed in a natural environment, so testing with colors in wavelengths closer to those we find in nature would very likely change the results. Prototyping is a game-changer when it comes to the production of knowledge. Role 4: Often, before new scientific discoveries, there was the development of an instrument or technic that led or allowed the analyses of the phenomena. During my time at a scientific institution, we would recall stories of times when research corroborating a particular hypothesis was highly celebrated vs the development of a new technic. The paradigm has definitely shifted as administration and scientists realized that these technical developments (ex. electric microscopy technics) were as important, enabling meaningful and ground-breaking discoveries by studying a phenomenon with \u201cnew lenses\u201d. Concluding that the documentation of a process is as relevant as the result of a certain research project. If prototypes are designed to capture information relevant to the development of a project, then surveys will serve that purpose, and as someone that worked in science project management, that is something I am familiar with, this relates to Role 2 . Also, another role I used before is Role 3 , while proposing the construction of a space for visitors at science exhibitions. In order to present a space designed to take time to critically think about what they\u2019ve experienced, read, or seen. I can only conclude that our life and life\u2019s work is a huge design intervention and we are constantly prototyping. Due to the time I\u2019ve spent around scientists, I can not help but be drawn to Role 1 as my default setting for prototyping. As an avid consumer of anything science fiction, I am curious to see what projects I can place in Role 3 as an insightful exercise into possible realities. On another note\u2026 How much are science and design related to each other? At the beginning of the class, when asked if we had ever used such roles, my immediate response was \u201cNot really, but I guess kind of\u2026\u201d. I was sure science and design were operating on different universes. After taking the time to stop and think about how I used the roles before, I see why I hesitated to firmly answer the question, yet I now recognize these areas of knowledge as complementary with the potential to enrich each other\u2019s research!
