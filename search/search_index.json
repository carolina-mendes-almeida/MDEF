I was thinking of how I could get the most out of my medium when I found abandoned basil plants (2) casually hanging out just beside some bikes at Fablab.

The chase of the unknown and the challenge keeps you in movement. Restless curiosity keeps the apathy of the world far away from you. And, once we saw the Petri boxes full of textures, reflections, colors and life, more questions popped up: How many types of organisms are on the Petri box? Were they all part of the microbiome of the bug or the basil leaf? Should I make more mediums to isolate each colony of bacteria? Do I have any of these microorganisms within me? How different am I from them? If they are the least complex out of the 3 biological domains, why do they seem so well organized? How can I contribute to their well-being? Can I ally with these beings? Two months ago, in The New Yorker printed issue of 15 th of August, Jill Lepore\u2019s comment was published with the title: \u201cBringing Back the Woolly Mammoth: Americans have long understood the species\u2019 extinction as a warning. But is trying to \u201cde-extinct\u201d it really a good idea?\u201d. Mammoths ( Mammuthus sp. ) were part of the megafauna of the Pleistocene. They were herbivorous mammals that inhabited big areas from cold tundra steppe, arid grasslands, to temperate savanna-parklands, thanks to paleontological records scientists were able to identify different species and morphologies that enabled Mammuthus sp. to survive in these different environments (Enk J. et al., 2016). Now, with biotechnological advancements, companies like Colossal, work to bring back mammoths to recover lost ecological functions that could mitigate climate change. The plan, as Jill wrote, is for de-extinct mammoths to \u201cpopulate the permafrost and avert its melting by turning wet tundra into dry grasslands, which better sequester carbon and reflect sunlight, keeping the permafrost cooler and helping, thereby, to save the planet.\u201d It is important to keep the permafrost because these soil layers are often wet as well as cold, affecting oxidation/reduction, decomposition, and other biogeochemical processes. Storing organic matter underneath it since the Pleistocene (Ping C. et al., 2015). Zimov, N. S. et al. (2005) presented scenarios suggesting a rapid release of tens of kg C m2 when permafrost disappears. They also explored a solution: replacing the arid regions of Eastern Siberia (mossy forests and tundra dominated) with productive grasslands and abundant herbivorous animals. This transition could have effects on energy exchange strong enough, to reduce permafrost temperature and methane emission, allowing accumulation of tens of kg C m2. With the death of the mammoth came the extinction of a habitat: Mammoth Steppe a distinctive, now-vanished biome dominated by large mammal grazers (Wang, Y. et al., 2021) So, this is why this species is the Colossal\u2019s first choice of de-extinction as a climate change mitigation solution, the mammoth could enable the transition from tundra to the mammoth steppe. Creative and new solutions like this become more urgent with today\u2019s climate crisis. Governments are failing us and \u201ctrends in biodiversity have been declining and are projected to continue to do so\u201d (2020, Global Biodiversity Outlook 5). We need to keep looking for innovative ways of tackling this global issue, but is de-extinction the way to go? This last paragraph established a \u201cwhy\u201d, yet the questions keep coming. Jill, wrote that Colossal is planning on bringing the first mammoth calves by 2025. But where? We don\u2019t have the mammoth biome of 10.000 years ago and we will need it because once the technical hurdles of creating viable offspring of extinct animals are overcome, the species becomes a reintroduction candidate (J\u00f8rgensen D. et al.,2013). And we still do not agree on what the ultimate extinction cause of mammoths was (Lorenzen et al., 2011; Nikolskiy et al., 2011). It leaves us with more questions: Would it be a meaningful addiction to the local ecosystems? Could it regenerate the mammoth steppe or would it just worsen the condition of the current? What will the genetic pools of this mammoth population look like? Would they have evolutionary resistance? Before attempting de-extinction we should carefully access reintroduction parameters, as we cannot bring a living creature back to a non-existent habitat or one it cannot survive. But, let\u2019s say we do manage to have the habitat, then ultimately the success of the reintroduction would depend on their genetic arrangement and resilience to the current abiotic and biotic human-induced changes. Yet, even if Colossal manages to fill the genetic gaps in the mammoth genome it will be very difficult to secure the sustainability of a population with such little genetic material. The result would be low genetic variation within the population and increased inbreeding. There can also be undetected consequences beyond genetics for example epigenetics, behavior care or transmission of the microbiome, inputs very difficult to obtain if it was created in a biotechnological experiment or raised by other species (Robert a. et al, 2017). Unfortunately, I recognize these discontinuations as ingredients for an extinction vortex, putting the mammoth in line for its second-time extinction. I would also like to highlight that de-extinction is a great name for marketing and getting funds as it signifies undoing extinction when in reality Colossal is attempting to create a hybrid of an Asian Elephant that has cold resistance, smaller ears, fur and a thicker layer of fat, so it can withstand the cold of the tundra and fulfill its ecological role. This is not de-extinction, this is CRISPR-Cas9 enabling genetic improvements, because in the end once the extinction line is crossed you cannot undo it. And, this is the tip of the iceberg because I haven\u2019t even remotely touched the cultural or socioeconomic reality. One of the reasons conservation initiatives can fail is because of a lack of context, and species reintroduction is a conservation technic. The socioeconomic implications of the project have to be properly assessed as \u201chuman acceptance of reintroduction projects will be a crucial aspect to consider for de-extinction\u201d (J\u00f8rgensen, D. et al., 2013). And even if everything from the DNA editing to the populating of the permafrost works out, there are still bioethical questions needing answers: Does Colossal own these animals? What does this mean for the Nagoya Protocol? Are we going to have mammoth hamburgers and themed parks? As J\u00f8rgensen D. (2013) said de-extinction is not simply an intermediate between reintroduction and invasion, but much can be learned from case studies on these topics. There are issues of de-extinction that we are familiar with due to other conservation projects, but there is a dark side to the moon that we are not able to foresee. This is so innovative, some argue is parallel to the moon landing, but I agree with Jill\u2019s comment it makes almost no sense; it\u2019s too little, too late. It is great to entertain billionaires but as an innovative climate change solution\u2026 too late. My opinion changes when it comes to recently extinct species as, in the case of reintroductions, times between local extinction and the planned release range from a few years to a few 100 years, the levels of divergence between the environment and a de-extinct population would be less intense than the 4.000 year mammoth gap (Robert a. et al, 2017). How we answer these questions has the potential of shaping our biomes and the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere, but one thing about scientists, they don\u2019t stop in the face of adversity they thrive in these challenging environments. In the time spare, I can only hope the 75 million dollars invested in this company will help develop new scientific technics in genomics that could help us in different areas (from health to conservation). \u201cIt\u2019s a similar kind of ambitious, engineering-focused, team-based target that President Kennedy set when he declared we would put a person on the moon within a decade. The scientific challenges of this project are considerable but ultimately surmountable. The bioethical dimensions are paramount. The execution will no doubt be daunting.

The Creative Community Mapping is our main assignment for this week. We did this for a specific group/association as a case studio during class. I joined Wen and Cag\u00e7un as we were interested in an Association in the UK working with Earthships. This case study was retrieved from a document given during class. For the homework, I applied the same thought process for TopManta, one of the associations in Barcelona I would like to connect with. (Creative Communities examples used in class: Meroni, Anna. Creative communities. People inventing sustainable ways of living. Edizioni Polidesign, 2007.) Power Dynamics Power Dynamics When talking about community, as oneness and togetherness, it feels like we have set an intention of acting towards a greater good. Yes, you can recycle, compost, go vegan, or zero-waste but to do so embedded in a community is empowering and establishes stronger bonds - a blueprint for societal change. There is power in numbers. This takes us to what was tackled later in the week: power. I believe I have power but most of the time I am unaware of how much. After coming across the following papers: 1) \u201cThe P-Word: Power aversion and responsibility aversion as explanations for the avoidance of power\u201d; 2) \u201cWho Wants to Get to the Top? Class and Lay Theories About Power\u201d, my view on power changed as I realized that my background (mixed race woman and raised in a family of immigrants), values and principles constrained my views, search and the notion of power. In summary, these papers speak about how some communities, especially those on the margins of society, do not actively search for positions of power and even avoided it, by thinking it is inherently negative (something I related to). So why do individuals from lower classes don\u2019t seek power as avidly as higher-class individuals? Low-class individuals are less interested in seeking positions of power using political means, and as a result less interested in seeking positions of power more broadly; They perceive that for advancement you need to play politics, so they then fail to pursue advancement and further contribute to their low status; There is inner conflict, lower class individuals tend to focus on the community more than on themselves clashing with some concepts of pursuing positions of power in politics; But there are two particular situations where low-class individuals are as interested in acquiring positions of power as individuals from higher classes: \u201cwhen advancement comes explicitly from prosocial means rather than from political means and to some extent when they frame power as a superordinate other-focused goal\u201d. It highlights how difficult but how necessary it is to have class-based diversity within power positions. The community-driven professional goals of BIPOC folks are well represented in this example given by Neil deGrasse (Astrophysicist) when one of his (black) friends says: \u201cAstrophysics? The black community cannot afford the luxury of someone of your intellect to spend it on that subject.\u201d Making him feel guilty about not doing enough to help others. You can watch the full video here: A Story About Race Neil deGrasse Tyson - YouTube . Not to say that every BIPOC struggle is due to our conception of power, it is much more complex, but it is freeing to detach evilness from power and move forward without that guilt. Representation and Diversity Just like sustainability, these words are thrown around every day. But what does it mean to have representation and diversity within a group of people? It means to consciously open space to those who have been marginalized by society (at different levels), it\u2019s creating equal opportunities through equity,\u2026 And there is the need to actively do so! We have to be intentional in opening these spaces because historically, for centuries, there were intentional acts of discrimination that led to generational consequences, keeping these groups under the tight and inhumane grip of exploitation, translating into a societal system that has roots in colonization, capitalism, and ecological destruction. Also, it is a fact that diversity is a driver of innovation, creativity, and productivity. The \u201cwhy\u201d is settled, but \u201chow\u201d is the million-dollar question. I was the 1 black student in 300 students at my Bachelor\u2019s in Biology (Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon). If, any of the professors opened a job/intern opportunity no matter how inclusive they would like to be the chances of that person being BIPOC was 1/300. There is so much resistance in the current system to open space to unprivileged and marginalized groups in higher education. So, clearly, something happens before college because 1/300 is not representative of the BIPOC population interested in life sciences (Lisbon - Portugal), and I believe that institutions that produce new knowledge and are aiming to lead a new generation of free thinkers must have this subject as one of their higher priorities: the inclusion of BIPOC, Queer and LGBTQ+, People with disabilities, cognitive and background diversity. Design can be hopeful and open doors to new realities that are non-western centric: Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9: How to build with clay\u2026 and community - YouTube Futures Literacy What a privilege it is to have these Future perspectives, possibilities and realities colliding and even to develop foresight skills as the majority awakes to the threats of the socio-ecological crisis, a feeling of despair that is so familiar to Indigenous, Queer and many diaspora communities around the world. When researching about the community I was trying to search for resources that were non-western centered, when something came up called: Futures Literacy (FL) , something I have never heard of but has been around since the beginning of this century. FL is rooted in the notions of \u201cusing the future\u201d. \u201cThe future does not exist in the present but anticipation does. The form the future takes in the present is anticipation.\u201d Using the cross-over of theory and practice of Anticipation Systems (AS), the future is integrated into the present, and that happens constantly trough out our daily-life having the potential of helping us overturn into new frames of mind. For example: Efforts to recognise and preserve cultural heritage, in all its forms, are fundamentally linked to views of the past, present and future. As a result, the anticipatory assumptions that form the foundation for imagining the future play a determinant role in understanding what cultural heritage is, which aspects are deemed worth preserving and how to attempt to assure durability or continuity. I am interested in researching more on FL to redeem colonization and Bayo Akomolafe , the writer and founder of The Emergence Network in Nigeria, has some great thoughts on this topic \u201cColonisation was really about homogenization and mass production. It was also about the sterilization of hope, the failure of imagination, and the condensation of the manifold to a single story.\u201d There are more stories and futures beyond the capitalist, colonizer and industrial imposed ones under the (still) suffocating systems of oppression, there are futures that look like community, unity, abundance, and diversity, which are welcoming and freeing. Those emerging possibilities are the ones I am fighting for. Facilitating To be a facilitator is a role of great responsibility. It is the role of an active listener, mediator, curator, communicator, time manager, open-minded and at the center of everything a great facilitator is a channel of love and tolerance for that particular group. This word was introduced to the class and attached to another concept: Social Capital. As we are all part of a group in relation to something else. That lead us to the final exercise of the week where we embodied a system to better understand it. This is when M\u00e9rce introduced us to Embodied Theatre. With that exercise we explored with our bodies the role of students, politics, citizens, money, governments, research and funding I then explored another topic that I was constantly confroted with in the past related to excellence and expertise (meritocracy systems). No (self) judgment and meritocracy With the time I spent in Scientific institutions, there was an underlying discussion of what is excellence. Excellence has always been viewed as an ally to scientific innovation, but is it really? This is currently a hot topic in scientific institutions. I came across this AEON article that exposes the following thoughts: - rather than excellence a team of people should bring diverse knowledge bases, tools and analytic skills to the table - Optimal hiring depends on context - \u201cgiven a specific task and the composition of a particular team, one would be more likely to contribute than another\u201d \u2018Having people who have different mental perspectives is what\u2019s important. If you want to explore things you haven\u2019t explored, having people who look just like you and think just like you is not the best way.\u2019 - Astro Teller, CEO of X - \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d Mentioned article: Why hiring the best people produces the least creative results But what happens when you have the role of facilitator within an environment that places you in contact with something more-than-human? As we moved into the assignments related to Design Dialogues this particular theme shined the brighter and reminded me of what Ron Wakkary said during his lecture: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to be inclusionary but it is possible to be tentacular and collective in our design.\u201d Since then, together with the group Augmented Creativity - Myrto, Stella, Paige, Mariana and I - decided to join forces to bring in order to explore the following question: How to facilitate interactions with something that is more than human?

Also, it is a fact that diversity is a driver of innovation, creativity, and productivity. The \u201cwhy\u201d is settled, but \u201chow\u201d is the million-dollar question. I was the 1 black student in 300 students at my Bachelor\u2019s in Biology (Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon). If, any of the professors opened a job/intern opportunity no matter how inclusive they would like to be the chances of that person being BIPOC was 1/300. There is so much resistance in the current system to open space to unprivileged and marginalized groups in higher education. So, clearly, something happens before college because 1/300 is not representative of the BIPOC population interested in life sciences (Lisbon - Portugal), and I believe that institutions that produce new knowledge and are aiming to lead a new generation of free thinkers must have this subject as one of their higher priorities: the inclusion of BIPOC, Queer and LGBTQ+, People with disabilities, cognitive and background diversity. Design can be hopeful and open doors to new realities that are non-western centric: Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9: How to build with clay\u2026 and community - YouTube Futures Literacy What a privilege it is to have these Future perspectives, possibilities and realities colliding and even to develop foresight skills as the majority awakes to the threats of the socio-ecological crisis, a feeling of despair that is so familiar to Indigenous, Queer and many diaspora communities around the world. When researching about the community I was trying to search for resources that were non-western centered, when something came up called: Futures Literacy (FL) , something I have never heard of but has been around since the beginning of this century. FL is rooted in the notions of \u201cusing the future\u201d. \u201cThe future does not exist in the present but anticipation does. The form the future takes in the present is anticipation.\u201d Using the cross-over of theory and practice of Anticipation Systems (AS), the future is integrated into the present, and that happens constantly trough out our daily-life having the potential of helping us overturn into new frames of mind. For example: Efforts to recognise and preserve cultural heritage, in all its forms, are fundamentally linked to views of the past, present and future. As a result, the anticipatory assumptions that form the foundation for imagining the future play a determinant role in understanding what cultural heritage is, which aspects are deemed worth preserving and how to attempt to assure durability or continuity. I am interested in researching more on FL to redeem colonization and Bayo Akomolafe , the writer and founder of The Emergence Network in Nigeria, has some great thoughts on this topic \u201cColonisation was really about homogenization and mass production. It was also about the sterilization of hope, the failure of imagination, and the condensation of the manifold to a single story.\u201d There are more stories and futures beyond the capitalist, colonizer and industrial imposed ones under the (still) suffocating systems of oppression, there are futures that look like community, unity, abundance, and diversity, which are welcoming and freeing. Those emerging possibilities are the ones I am fighting for. Facilitating To be a facilitator is a role of great responsibility. It is the role of an active listener, mediator, curator, communicator, time manager, open-minded and at the center of everything a great facilitator is a channel of love and tolerance for that particular group. This word was introduced to the class and attached to another concept: Social Capital. As we are all part of a group in relation to something else. That lead us to the final exercise of the week where we embodied a system to better understand it. This is when M\u00e9rce introduced us to Embodied Theatre. With that exercise we explored with our bodies the role of students, politics, citizens, money, governments, research and funding I then explored another topic that I was constantly confroted with in the past related to excellence and expertise (meritocracy systems). No (self) judgment and meritocracy With the time I spent in Scientific institutions, there was an underlying discussion of what is excellence. Excellence has always been viewed as an ally to scientific innovation, but is it really? This is currently a hot topic in scientific institutions. I came across this AEON article that exposes the following thoughts: - rather than excellence a team of people should bring diverse knowledge bases, tools and analytic skills to the table - Optimal hiring depends on context - \u201cgiven a specific task and the composition of a particular team, one would be more likely to contribute than another\u201d \u2018Having people who have different mental perspectives is what\u2019s important. If you want to explore things you haven\u2019t explored, having people who look just like you and think just like you is not the best way.\u2019 - Astro Teller, CEO of X - \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d Mentioned article: Why hiring the best people produces the least creative results But what happens when you have the role of facilitator within an environment that places you in contact with something more-than-human? As we moved into the assignments related to Design Dialogues this particular theme shined the brighter and reminded me of what Ron Wakkary said during his lecture: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to be inclusionary but it is possible to be tentacular and collective in our design.\u201d Since then, together with the group Augmented Creativity - Myrto, Stella, Paige, Mariana and I - decided to join forces to bring in order to explore the following question: How to facilitate interactions with something that is more than human?

Role 1: This would have been a useful approach to a project in the third year of my Biology Bachelor\u2019s degree. For a class on population dynamics, I had the idea to test if the color preference of Harmonia axyridis is sex-dependent, meaning if males and females have the same color preference. In nature, that could translate into high probabilities of finding males and females in the same-colored flowers. It ended up being an inconclusive study, due to many factors, but now I see how I should\u2019ve spent more time prototyping different experimental sets. The set for this experiment consisted of a 30x38cm transparent acrylic box and in each corner, there were different colored sticker paper (yellow, green, blue and red). Insects like Harmonia axyridis have apical tendencies (to visit the apex of branches/buds), even though it was not registered this could be a possible non-detected variable: the colors of the stickers on top of the box vs the colors placed at the basis of the acrylic box. Another example of a non-tested variable is the intensity of the colors. For instance, the chosen colors were very bright and rarely observed in a natural environment, so testing with colors in wavelengths closer to those we find in nature would very likely change the results. Prototyping is a game-changer when it comes to the production of knowledge. Role 4: Often, before new scientific discoveries, there was the development of an instrument or technic that led or allowed the analyses of the phenomena. During my time at a scientific institution, we would recall stories of times when research corroborating a particular hypothesis was highly celebrated vs the development of a new technic. The paradigm has definitely shifted as administration and scientists realized that these technical developments (ex. electric microscopy technics) were as important, enabling meaningful and ground-breaking discoveries by studying a phenomenon with \u201cnew lenses\u201d. Concluding that the documentation of a process is as relevant as the result of a certain research project. If prototypes are designed to capture information relevant to the development of a project, then surveys will serve that purpose, and as someone that worked in science project management, that is something I am familiar with, this relates to Role 2 .

By adding coffee grounds (waste) to the clay the porosity of the material is increased. This might be helpful for certain ecological artifacts, ex. ollas. So I took this opportunity to try and incorporate this element into natural clay as another physical experiment inspired by my digital design space. collect coffee grounds dry the collected coffee grounds (microwaved for 2min.) incorporate into the clay add the necessary water This idea was inspired by the following study: Manni, A., El Haddar, A., El Hassani, I.

The smell of clay, the touch of spikes, the sound of insects, the colors of flowers, etc. all of that contributed to the realization that 1PP is valuable because it enriches research with human senses and humane actions. With the 1PP design, it felt more purpose-driven. I do think I am still very much a Prototype Role 1 kind of designer but I will definitely incorporate a 1PP as valuable input. Why add coffee? By adding coffee grounds (waste) to the clay the porosity of the material is increased. This might be helpful for certain ecological artifacts, ex. ollas. So I took this opportunity to try and incorporate this element into natural clay as another physical experiment inspired by my digital design space. collect coffee grounds dry the collected coffee grounds (microwaved for 2min.) incorporate into the clay add the necessary water This idea was inspired by the following study: Manni, A., El Haddar, A., El Hassani, I. E. E. A., El Bouari, A., & Sadik, C. (2019). Valorization of coffee waste with Moroccan clay to produce a porous red ceramics (class BIII). Bolet\u00edn de la Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Cer\u00e1mica y Vidrio, 58 (5), 211-220. Next Steps\u2026 From this exercise I could derivate 2 more activities: I want to share the clay tablet with kids in the playground, interact and see how they respond (I want to interfere as little as possible, at least in the beginning, even if it means the end of the clay tablet). Because I want to get as much as I can from these leaves, I will do a cyanotype print for some of the leaves (it is also a way to protect the documentation, if the kids in the playground destroy the clay tablet)","title":"Living With Your Ideas"},{"location":"term1/lwyi/02-lwyi/","text":"Living With Your Ideas / COMPANION \u00b6 The Shaker by Carolina Almeida","title":"Companion"},{"location":"term1/lwyi/02-lwyi/#living-with-your-ideas-companion","text":"The Shaker by Carolina Almeida","title":"Living With Your Ideas / COMPANION"},{"location":"term1/tech/fromcoffeetobubbles/","text":"Tech Beyond the Myth \u00b6 From a Coffee Machine to a Bubblemaker We went from imagining the processes of other designers to making an artifact ourselves.
